Thank you for saving my best friend's life.,"I had a long conversation with my best friend last night.  She's just come out of a mental health facility where she stayed for awhile in order to get some help.  She has battled with deep depression for years, but kept her pain and agony mostly to herself. I'm her best friend of 20 years and even I didn't know what kind of pain &amp; darkness she was dealing with.   Last night she told me that she came here one night when she was at her lowest point. She had a plan. She was ready. Her plan would not have resulted in a cry for help, it would have ended her life, no question.  It was the compassion &amp; understanding she received here that made her decide to get help instead of taking the quick way out.  Some wonderful person took her to a private conversation and spent a lot of time with her.  This is a direct quote from my friend, ""They reached in through the darkness and offered me a helping hand when I needed it most."" My friend is a kind person with a big heart and is well loved by me, her friends and her family.  I don't know what I would have done had she not found some help here.

This is probably because I am a very happy person and have no reason to be researching suicide; until recently.Since coming to college, I have made some relatively close friends, who as I am getting to know more and more, are very sad people.  One of them just recently opened up to me the other night when we were both very drunk, and she told me that her father molested her when she was little, and that she hates her parents.  She cuts herself and keeps a noose prepared in her backpack.  I am scared.  I am scared that I am going to wake up tomorrow and have 1 or 2 less friends, and I don't know what i'd do if that happened.I have suggested to both of my friends (the other one is not quite as depressed but he is currently hardly functioning in life, not focusing on school, also has serious family issues) that they seek professional help.  They have both rejected this idea and said that they will continue to internalize it.I am at a loss for ideas, I spend a huge amount of time talking them out of crazed depression and often worried about suicide threats.  I can't handle this forever, and i'm doing everything I can for them but I don't know what is right and what is wrong to help them.Please offer me some advice.  If you would like to know more about them or their situations let me know.Thank you.(TL;DR, 2 suicidal depressed friends, need help in helping them)",277,9.78,62.74,56.77,1.19,27.70,15.88,94.22,59.21,23.10,16.25,7.94,0.36,0.72,3.61,3.61,6.86,2.17,10.47,11.91,5.42,8.66,2.17,18.41,5.42,2.89,2.17,2.17,3.61,6.86,1.81,5.05,1.44,0.72,2.17,16.25,1.08,1.44,3.25,0.72,11.91,3.25,1.44,1.44,3.61,0.72,3.97,0.36,0.00,0.36,0.00,1.44,0.36,0.72,0.00,0.36,7.22,3.61,0.72,3.25,0.36,1.08,2.53,14.08,1.81,11.91,0.72,5.78,5.05,1.44,0.72,0.36,0.36,0.00,1.44,0.72,0.00,0.36,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.80,5.42,4.69,0.00,0.72,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.17,1.44,0.36

I'm only 17 years old so it may just be teen angst but I feel just simply depressed a lot of the time. I would not let it get to the point that I would kill myself because I know I can't do that to my family. I just look at everyone around me and I feel like every single person I'm close withs life would be better off without me. I know killing myself couldn't solve that problem though. I just imagine a world without me and everyone seems more happy. Its like that episode of fairly odd parents when Timmy makes the wish that he was never born and sees how much happier his parents and friends are. I feel like that is me. My parents could have saved thousands of dollars that they put towards my education. I just needed to share this with someone. I know this may not be a big deal on this subreddit because its looking out for people who are on the verge of suicide but I would love for someone to talk to about this.

2564,due8r,14457,1287672349,SuicideWatch,"Thirty years ago this morning, I woke up in a dear friend's bed, to the news he had killed himself.","_PERSON_ was my college roommate before he ate a bottle of Sominex and got sent home. It was his second or third such event and the school had decided to give up on him.Because he always used over-the-counter pills, a bunch of us believed he wasn't really trying to die, just calling out for help. In retrospect, we should have realized that he was using those pills because he couldn't get his hands on anything stronger.I dropped out myself at the end of the semester, and got a room in a cheap boarding house on the edge of campus. I talked _PERSON_ into moving into the house with me because I thought it was better than the alternative, which was living with his parents, whose house was nearby but who seemed incapable of dealing with any human emotion, least of all his.After a couple of months of living on his childhood savings account, another friend of ours named _PERSON_, also a dropout at this point, decided to move out west, and talked _PERSON_ into coming with him. They settled into a one-bedroom apartment. _PERSON_ took the bed and _PERSON_ settled into a permanent spot sleeping on the couch. This didn't surprise anyone who knew _PERSON_. He had the lowest self-esteem of anyone I have ever called my friend._PERSON_ found work in the new city but it was always terrible work, like sitting in a bulletproof booth at an all-night gas station, getting threatened and spat at by psycho customers.Almost a year went by. I was still working in the college town, while _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ did their respective things out west. We talked on the phone a lot. _PERSON_ always seemed so lost, and wandering into situation after situation that only made things worse, like those gas station gigs.Then came October 1980, and word that _PERSON_ was going to play a concert on his tour for ""The River"" in _PERSON_ and _PERSON_'s town. They drove _PERSON_'s beat-up car back to the college town, to see some friends, they said, and to give me a ride to the concert.Only _PERSON_ wrecked the car the night before we were supposed to leave. We were stranded. We had our _PERSON_ tickets, but no money.That is, until _PERSON_ came to the rescue. He made a couple hundred bucks appear as it from nowhere. He bought me and _PERSON_ two AMTRAK tickets back to the west, and said he'd follow us out as soon as the car was fixed. We promised to pay him back.We all went to the train station the night we left. _PERSON_ and I sat on two of those hard plastic-shell chairs at a corner of the terminal and laughed our butts off, telling stories and just shooting the breeze. It was wonderful. I was starting to think _PERSON_ was going to be OK. He seemed so much more at ease. It wasn't until afterwards I realized why: He had made the decision to die. That must have felt like a huge weight off his shoulders.So he got me and _PERSON_ out of town on the train and went back to his parents' house. And on the night of Oct 20, 1980 he drove their car to a park where he had played as a boy and shot himself in the head.The call came early, and my head was still ringing from _PERSON_'s fabulous 4-hour concert the night before, and everything I had ingested during it. I was on _PERSON_'s couch, using his pillow and blanket in a futile effort to find, as _PERSON_ said, a way to hold my head that didn't hurt. _PERSON_ answered the phone.It was _PERSON_'s mom, matter-of-factly informing us of his suicide, and asking us to please return his personal possessions to them as soon as we could.I will never forget that hammer shot of astonishment, of realizing for the first time that he really had it in him to take his own life, that I had been wrong all along. And now it was too late to fix it.I remember stumbling out of the apartment and walking three or four blocks to a neighborhood bodega, not so much to buy anything but because I needed to get out. I walked in and the store owner immediately started yelling at me. I didn't understand what he was saying -- it may have been a language I didn't know, or maybe my brain just wasn't processing the sound of his voice. But I got the message from his outstretched index finger: Get out. It was only when I turned to leave that I saw my bloody footprints all over his floor, and realized I had left the apartment barefoot and stepped on something sharp at some point. I never felt a thing. Except for shame. I tried to apologize but the owner just kept pointing at the door and yelling.I used to get sad every October, without really understanding why, and then I'd remember that the anniversary of _PERSON_'s suicide was coming up. This went on for maybe 10 years. More recently the date has come and gone without my really thinking about it. Though I still think about poor _PERSON_ all the time.Sometime in the past year I realized, for the first time, that _PERSON_, who was a huge _PERSON_ fan, killed himself on the anniversary of the plane crash. That sent a chill through me.And of course like so many humans, round numbers stick out in my head. So the 30th anniversary has been front and center in my mind these last few days.We were both 21 that day. I suppose he still is. I have a wife and kids, and have worked a bunch of jobs, including one I have right now that I love. I've been fortunate to see a lot of the world.I'm typing this on a laptop in the basement of the house I've owned and occupied for more than a decade. I've seen and done so many things I am grateful for having experienced, while _PERSON_ has lain in a grave not far from his parents' old house, frozen in time forever as a sad, confused kid.If you're out there _PERSON_ and you recognize yourself in this story, sing out.

2656,k0v3h,35429,1314843040,SuicideWatch,Back again!,"Ok guys. This was [me](_URL_ for the entire last month. I've was never in a depressive episode this long. Usually it would last for a week, at the max, and then I would be back to cheerful self again. I just feel better since the last couple of hours. I do not know why. I am going to see a psychologist  to find out how I can combat the next depressive episode when I have it. I have a fair idea how though. I've been through this shit and now I want to help you guys who are feeling down like I did before. I've been thinking about it since I got out of it. Here are a few points.1. During depression, the only thing that I was doing was thinking about suicide. I had no time for basic hygiene or proper eating. That is where I disgusted myself and this lead to more depression like a cycle. Make sure you are in a clean environment. If you are not, clean it up immediately. When your environment is organized, so are you. Take care of hygiene.2. When you are in depression, the worst thing that you can do is stop eating/drinking. I did that for roughly 3-4 days. Yesterday, I drank a little bit of water and felt sick to the stomach. Today, when I was back to normal again and tried to walk a little bit, I just puked because the exercise was straining me. Seriously, you do not want to do this to yourself. It is very painful and your stomach hurts like you were stabbed and the would sealed off, but the damage to the stomach wasn't corrected. Two bottles of milk helped with getting my energy back. Also, if you eat the stuff that you love or enjoy, it will be good for you and might help you a little bit with getting rid of the depression.3. During depression, as I mentioned earlier, the only thing that I could think of was suicide. I tried many of those methods and failed pretty bad. There is no sure-fire way of committing suicide. Each method is more painful than the next and the last couple of moments that you may end up spending in this world will be your most painful. That is what I learnt. My survival instincts kicked in and got rid of all the suicidal devices that I had thought of and because of that I am still here. Thanks for that. There is no easy way out. It's very difficult and painful. You may end up regretting it.4. My parents and my sister found out that I hadn't been going to office and called me and asked about the problem. My father almost broke down on the phone when he found out that I was suffering from depression. There are people that  care for you. I kept myself in a shell for about 40 days and nothing came out of it. I talked to my Dad and realized that he'd probably be depressed if I did anything to myself and would probably be asking the question ""What did I miss? Did I do something wrong? I could have helped him"" time and again to himself. He wouldn't find an answer because I am not rational when I am depressed. I am just trying to find a way out without worrying about the consequences. It's not like I have a life-threatening disease or can't do anything on my own. I am in working condition and instead of using it to the fullest, I am just throwing it away. For what reason? That I feel frustrated with life. That instead of solving the little issues, I just go like ""Fuck it"" and think about suicide. That is not the correct way to think. Please understand that. And seriously, if you have depression, go seek advice from a doctor. You are not the only with these issues. There are tons of people who suffer from depression and if not corrected within time, it ends up being worse and eventually leads to suicide. The people who care about the victim end up in trauma and depressed themselves. They are the ones who question ""What could I have done to stop this?"" They will never find an answer. Why do you want to subject people who care about you to that experience? Take care of them.",746,27.30,40.47,73.67,1.00,12.43,14.08,95.31,64.88,19.84,11.80,7.51,0.00,3.08,0.67,0.54,8.04,5.90,14.21,12.06,7.77,6.84,2.55,20.91,3.35,2.14,2.68,1.07,1.88,8.45,2.55,5.90,0.40,0.54,2.68,8.04,0.54,0.27,0.13,1.21,13.81,3.75,2.28,2.41,3.08,1.47,3.22,1.74,0.13,0.13,1.34,3.22,0.54,1.47,0.13,0.94,5.50,0.67,1.34,2.01,1.07,1.47,5.90,11.53,1.34,13.40,1.07,6.03,6.70,1.21,0.27,0.00,0.13,0.00,0.80,0.40,0.27,0.00,0.13,0.00,0.00,14.08,7.37,2.68,0.00,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.40,0.80,1.34,0.13,0.67
2682,2viwcd,31528,1423651849,SuicideWatch,Being forced here by a thread.,"I write this as I should be walking out my door, starting yet another day of this broken existence of mine.  Failure has corrupted me.  Sadness has taken me.  I have finally been raped by the words of others, after years of remaining somewhat resolute.  I have lost those that I hold closest. In short, without going too far into my story - for the sake of time - I am sad, lonely, and I have no interest in living anymore.-I hit the snooze button again at this point-I have, for quite some time, been ambivalent towards the idea of death.  It's a scary prospect, not living anymore.  Through our existence, we have only known one thing, and that's life. It's what's familiar to us, and we are understandably scared of just not ""being"" anymore. I had, up until recently, not cared whether I lived or died.  I would be curious as to whether the large truck next to me on the road would suddenly swerve into my lane, throwing me off into the thick wooded area to my other side.  I had a nightmare about this once, I remember ,during better times, and it frightened me.  I didn't want to die.  I didn't want to have those last few seconds of struggle and confusion, leading to that nothingness.  I had things, people to live for. _PERSON_, I only have obligations.  My mind is diseased, unable to take happiness, knowing that it will eventually be taken from me, leaving a larger hole than the space that happiness once occupied. My heart is riddled with such holes, and I have no interest in forming any more.  I don't want to take the effort living up to the expectations of me. I simply can't, no matter how hard I try.  I have to put on a face - a mask - to hide the fact that I'm despairing so that others don't feel uncomfortable around me (this mask has since fallen off - apathy wins out again). Without being religious, I am a very morally-obsessed person.  I've studied more philosophy and psychology than anyone else I know.  I think it is this reason, as well as my own cowardice, that I am still here.  I can't bear the thought of leaving such a hole - as I have mentioned earlier - in the lives and hearts of others.  I can't seek treatment (though I have my personal objections against this, though probably illogical) because my parents would think that they are failures - that I am (as I am) a sick, depressed child that they created and led down this path (as I am not - this is my own doing). For the very same reasons and more, I cannot kill myself normally.  My friends - as few as they are - would hate themselves for ignoring the signs (or so I hope they would.  I don't know for certain), my parents for their ""failure"", the people I interact with every day for the fact that they could have tried (most likely without success, but I don't know) to make things better. As such, I have flirted with the idea of making it seem like an accident.  I can try to put on that happy mask again, go about living my life for another few months (and oh I can hardly bear that thought), and end up driving under the influence in my rural neighborhood (less chance of hurting someone else) and hitting some tree, most likely (the uncertainty of this example kills me) causing my death.  Then I'm dead just because I'm an idiot.  My parents have told me a thousand times to never drink and drive.  My friends do not know me to ever drink, so they would not blame themselves for not stopping such an occurrence.   Then again, I am a coward.  I don't think I'll do it. I want to, though.  Each day is so full of pain. I might edit this later.  I'll probably delete it eventually.",662,24.05,5.82,97.18,4.41,16.55,16.31,93.81,62.39,21.90,14.35,12.39,0.60,0.00,0.00,1.36,7.55,4.98,14.35,11.48,6.19,6.34,3.78,19.79,6.65,4.23,0.60,0.60,2.72,6.50,2.11,4.23,1.06,0.91,1.51,4.98,0.45,0.45,0.00,0.00,16.01,3.17,1.96,2.27,3.63,0.91,4.98,0.76,0.00,0.00,0.76,2.72,0.45,1.81,0.15,0.30,6.80,1.81,2.27,2.57,1.21,0.76,3.47,12.54,1.81,14.20,1.96,6.04,6.19,1.51,0.30,0.30,0.00,0.15,1.06,0.45,0.15,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.00,21.15,6.19,6.19,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.11,0.60,3.02,2.72,0.30

I know all the tricks of the trade, because I use them on people. Not saying that to be a jackass, just saying you can skip the formalities with me... I really just need to write these thoughts down, not have people like me go through the intervention steps :) Second, I'm not in any urgent danger. While I do have a plan, I haven't given away any items, nor do I have serious intent to kill myself... I really just need to share my emerging suicidal thoughts with someone... a stranger who doesn't know me.Anyways, on to the good stuff. I am such a pathetic piece of shit, it's unreal. I don't deserve to live. I know that if I killed myself, the world would be a better place for it. I bet you my parents and sister would cry for a bit, but they'd get over it pretty fast. Who knows if my brother would even show up for the funeral. My boyfriend may be a little sad, but at least this way he can find someone better. He deserves so much more than me. Did I mention how big of a piece of shit I am?I think about suicide as an outlet, not as an action plan, but it's becoming more and more frequent. I've decided that I'd take some pills and go to a park some where. My only worry is that some fragile person would find me dead and they'd be traumatized for life. However, I don't want to do it where any family members could find me.Of course, I could never go through with it. Who would drive my mother to and from her chemo? Not my brother or sister, that's for sure. I swear, if she didn't have cancer, I'd be dead. But I know I can't kill myself because then she'd be fucked. And don't let this fool you into thinking, ""you take care of your mother? You ARE a good person!"" Nope. Still a total piece of shit. I don't deserve happiness, I don't deserve anyone... I deserve to die. And I'm a little pissed that I can't kill myself. Now, if a horrible car accident happened that a) wasn't my fault and b) killed me, but didn't horribly traumatize the driver of the other car, I'd be pretty okay with that. Anyways, that's it.

This was to much and she's left me. I have held on to the idea that I could work on myself and she could herself and in 1.5 yrs (from now, 4 total) of paying spousal support, we'd both be independent and able to start dating each other again.. It didn't occur to me that there was an option of not reconciling. Dating other people during our ""break"" would be a growing thing... I would still be here for her if she needed anything or if someone hurt her or threatened to hurt her. I just found out she's getting re-married in January. I tried to tell myself I could stop it. I tried to believe I could do some grandiose act and change her mind. She's marrying him because he's solid, stable,....boring. Not emotionally reactive like me. Not with all this dark, perverse baggage, like me. She's not marrying him because she loves him. But, I've had to come to that realization. I made her say it last night. I said mean things until she quit trying to ""not hurt my feelings""..... I made her tell me how much anger and resentment comes up towards me when she thinks of me. I made her tell me how she can't see ever getting over us...me..not in this lifetime.. That she doesn't even want to. She wants to hang on to that hurt, to use it remind her of what can happen. She's not even trying to find forgiveness for me. I made her tell me she loves him.I feel that I had a contract to provide for and protect her. Yes, I broke one of the stipulations of that contract. But in some weird twisted vision I had, the highest concern was to provide for and protect her. I provided for her extremely well....well, for my education I did I suppose. My job took me away alot....but she drove a luxury sedan and lived in some of the nicer areas of the cities we lived in. She was safe and provided for. Like my contract stated. Now, there is no contract. Or so it would seem. She's released me from that contract with her. But, my heart doesn't feel that way. It feels like there was a blood oath that I must pay for. I promised her my life. I promised to give my life for her, to her. I promised something bigger than her, something bigger than me. I don't know if I'd call it ""god"", but certainly to the underlying consciousness of the universe. The consciousness that sees all, that knows all, that is all. I made a promise of my life to THAT. I feel like I should find her in person, walk up to her, and tell the Universe that ""The contract is paid""....and pull the trigger on a revolver with one bullet in some random chamber (Russian Roulette). At very least I should shoot my ring finger off. Or give the Universe the opportunity to do so.  I don't know how else to get this nagging feeling of owing blood to go away. tldr...

I grew up in a toxic environment with an abusive father and a mother who protected him. I moved out when I went to college. I was raped by my bf of 6 years; it pushed me over the edge and sent me to the psych ward. I got help, received counseling, and started medication. My depression wasn't so bad, and the incessant thoughts about ending my life finally stopped for the first time in years (literally, I thought about it EVERY DAY for YEARS). I moved back home because the place I was living increased their rent and I could not find work to help pay for the difference. I cleaned out the dump that was the basement and turned it into an ""apartment"" with curtain walls. Things were OK I guess, for a little while. My dad had gotten less violent, and I was rarely home. It's now been 2 semesters (almost a year). My depression has been coming back. At first, it was the general ""don't want to get out of bed in the morning"" feeling. Then it sucked the joy and fun from everything I cared about. Two days ago, the thoughts came back. I haven't even considered killing myself for the past year and a half, and now I can't get the thoughts out of my head. It's like a broken record in my brain playing over and over and over and over. TL;DR: Have depression. Took meds and got therapy to get rid of suicidal thoughts. They came back when I moved back home.

Then I got sick. Week after that, I had a death in the family. The next week was gone by running a Goodwill clothing drive that caused me to miss 2 exams. I asked my profs if I could take a make-up. One said no, and said I contacted her too late. I was OK with that. The other said yes, and asked me tons of questions afterwards. Like why didn't you tell me about this earlier? Why didn't you turn in a random assignment from 3 weeks ago? The judgmental look in her eye is just too much right now. I would understand the questions if they came BEFORE she decided to let me make up the test, but she's asking these AFTER. There's no way to explain everything to her. I don't know what to do.

I'm FINALLY able to walk around campus on most days and not have flashbacks. For the longest time, I'd have a flashback to my ex raping me every time I saw a guy that looked like him. I finally broke up with him; I left an abusive relationship. Not only that, I stayed in school and managed to continue passing classes despite moderate-severe depression. Then, I turned my attendance around. And because of extenuating circumstances I couldn't go to class for a few weeks in a row. I was too nervous and anxious to ask for help, and it took every ounce of courage to ask for a make-up. Now, despite all I've overcome, I have to endure more questions about why I missed a petty assignment a few weeks ago or was absent to a couple classes. I feel I've overcome enough in my life. I know I'll at least stick around until after my anniversary with my bf. That's all I have to hold on to right now.",375,58.20,16.85,98.17,2.41,13.89,13.33,94.40,58.93,18.93,14.93,12.00,0.00,0.53,2.13,0.27,4.00,6.40,17.33,8.80,6.67,4.53,2.40,21.33,5.07,3.20,1.33,1.07,3.73,3.73,0.53,3.20,0.53,0.80,1.33,8.00,0.27,0.80,1.60,1.33,12.53,2.93,2.67,1.33,2.40,1.87,3.73,2.13,1.07,0.80,0.27,1.07,0.27,0.53,0.27,0.00,5.07,1.33,0.80,1.87,1.33,0.00,8.53,11.73,1.07,18.40,2.93,6.40,9.60,4.27,0.53,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.27,1.33,0.00,0.53,0.53,0.00,0.00,15.47,6.67,3.20,0.00,0.27,0.53,0.00,0.80,0.00,3.73,0.00,0.27

I have had so many diagnoses that I don't think I'll ever really know what the fuck is wrong with me.  At 10 I tried to kill myself, not fully understanding what that meant, and I was diagnosed, ""severe emotional disturbance.""  How encouraging for a small, sad child.  A few years later it was ADD, then it was anxiety/depression.  My last suicide attempt (of very few) was in 2010.  I was 20 years old.  I didn't know the first thing about guns and thought that if I pulled the trigger it would just happen, but I was caught in the act.I have been taking Paxil 30mg once a day for about a year, after having been on countless other drugs that essentially only damaged my psyche further.  Adderall, Wellbutrin, Celexa, Lexapro, Depakote, Abilify, Concerta and the list goes on.  Every single one of these medications made me feel worse in one way or another.  For the first time, I'm on something that has stabilized me just enough so that I have the confidence and energy to work on myself properly.Well, right now my life is changing.  My dad is a heroin addict with a lot of psychological issues, and my relationship with him has always been unpleasant.  My parents split up when I was just 3 years old.  My dad comes in and out of my life.  When he was in it, he'd be physically and verbally abusive.  So I can't count him out of my support program.  My mom always took care of us well enough, but she was constantly searching for love and often times I'd take a backseat to her boyfriends.  More recently, she left my _PERSON_] and I in November to move across the country to live with a guy she just met, and left me to take care of both of us.  I had 2 weeks notice.  She's back home temporarily to get ready to move us out of this apartment.  My sister is going with her, and I have to find a place to live on my own.I don't want to live in this area anymore because it's too expensive, so I'm moving somewhere I'm not going to know a single soul.  I've always felt as though I was completely alone.  The people who are supposed to be me supporters are only really worried about themselves.  Now I'm truly going to be alone in a far away place.Last, I ran out of my medication last week.  I couldn't get ahold of my doctor, and I had no refills left.  Today I managed to get in contact with an emergency on-call psychiatrist, but no pharmacies in the area will be open until Monday at the *very* earliest.Things are stressful enough for me right now without having to worry about my meds.  Now I don't have them and the withdrawal symptoms are really getting to me.  I know if I had them, they wouldn't kick in immediately, but I'd at least have some peace of mind knowing they were there.",521,29.07,15.45,98.63,9.33,16.81,14.40,93.09,60.46,19.39,14.78,11.32,0.58,0.00,1.92,0.96,4.41,4.61,14.78,11.71,7.87,6.14,2.50,21.88,4.22,1.73,1.15,2.30,2.50,6.33,2.50,3.84,0.96,0.58,1.15,6.72,0.96,0.58,1.54,1.54,11.32,3.07,1.15,1.15,1.92,1.54,3.45,0.77,0.19,0.19,0.38,3.45,0.00,3.07,0.19,0.00,5.95,1.92,0.96,1.15,1.92,0.38,6.33,13.63,1.15,19.58,2.30,9.02,8.45,0.96,0.19,0.38,0.19,0.19,0.38,0.58,0.19,0.00,0.00,0.38,0.00,18.23,7.10,5.18,0.00,0.00,0.19,0.00,0.19,0.38,3.65,0.38,1.15

It seems like everybody I know and care about most of all has officially rejected me as a person all of a sudden, and just now my parents told me how disappointed they are in me too. (They can't come to terms with the fact I'm going to a small university they haven't heard of next year, instead of the Ivy League school they'd imagined for me.)I care about my friends deeply. This week, I found out that one has been lying to me about major things for the last few months because he doesn't actually trust me – he'd told me I was the only one who he could confide in, and it turns out that was all a huge lie that everyone was in on but me. Another was getting into major shit, so I did my best to get her out. She says she's sorting things out now, but she doesn't want to be friends any more. One of my closest friends of all has been making excuses about why we aren't in touch for the last two months and I feel like I barely know them any more. And the one who I care about most of all wishes I didn't and couldn't possibly be less interested in my own life.At this point, there's pretty much nobody out there who has done anything to suggest any remote interest in me as a human being, and I don't know if there has been for a long, long time now. My family sees me as a dead weight and a lost cause, and the people I thought were my friends have rewarded my care with contempt and disinterest.

I don’t think you’d say I’m “sad” to any degree. But in past months, generally spending more time reading up on current events as well as trying to have serious discussion with my friends. But every time I try to remotely try and introduce something serious to talk about (living by ourselves, internet censorship, et alia), within minutes it derails into a huge, exaggerated conversation about how funny if someone did this about it, or how people should do unrealistic things to solve problems. Being in China, I’m stuck with internet censorship, a general inability to protest or do any sort of activism without fearing of risk of prosecution or any sort of negative attention from the police. I don’t want to put my future at risk, or my parents and friends at risk as well.All of this has come to a head in the past day with the whole _PERSON_ bullshit. Yes, he needs to be killed _PERSON_ the Impaler style, I believe that he should have his eyes gouged out and sulfuric acid poured into his skull as well, but what about all the other atrocious acts going on right this minute? It’s impossible not only for myself to get anything done, but to even have serious, intellectual discourse with the people I am closest to. I figure it’d be easier on everybody if I just leap out my window, rather than have them deal with my _PERSON_: world seems hopelessly broken beyond the point of any return to me, and my friends are hopelessly mired in their immaturity. Seems easier to me to just go out and not deal with all this.Call me a coward, but honestly, if I could even find one person who could speak along the same lines as I do, it’d make this a whole lot better.

4475,2qvwk8,37682,1419998052,SuicideWatch,Been having a very very very bad month.,"So before all the events of this I've been dealing with issues of feeling really fucking worthless and having no human connections. I hate myself and realize that I'm just a financial burden on my family. I finished my Bachelors and Masters in molecular cell bio but no one would hire me. I spent a couple months doing some shitty minimum wage lab job as a temp then several more months unemployed rinse/repeat/live in your parents basement as a 27 year old. The one thing I love, where I can actually forget about this shit is when I go skiing (Always by myself).Fastfoward to a couple days before thanksgiving, my hike ran a little late and I was coming off the mountain while it was dark. I took a tumble and fractured my femur, the thing broke clean in half. A week long hospital stay and a surgery later and I am ready to go home. No skiing for the forseeable future when I live for the winter. Also it's the very end of the year and my super high deductible (6k$) resets. I know that I can't afford the physical therapy at year end and I go hard at it. Feelings of worthlessness and loneliness are now always in the back of my mind when talking to any human being.Now today...I totalled my fucking car...I'm not going to be able to replace it or go to work (I will probably be fired anyways) I already have medical bills I can't pay. The worst part is this all just confirms my fears that I can't even be trusted to drive down the fucking road. I'm so worthless I can't even handle a simple drive and my parents already absorb so much of the costs that how are they supposed to fucking retire? I can see what a disapointment I am on their faces everytime they look at me. It's that look of ""Oh we should have known he'd be too worthless to handle driving how would I prevent that in the future?""The things I do to distract myself from my loneliness just aren't working. I can't escape my own skin and it's all just too much for me to bare. I hate everything about myself and I can't even pretend to be okay anymore. I feel like everyone can even see it on my face.",402,28.13,6.79,98.16,1.22,22.33,14.43,92.54,58.46,19.65,13.93,12.44,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.75,5.72,6.47,11.19,8.96,7.96,6.97,2.74,16.42,5.72,1.99,1.74,1.00,2.99,5.97,1.24,4.48,0.25,1.99,1.49,4.23,0.75,0.00,0.00,0.50,9.45,2.24,0.75,0.75,1.24,1.99,2.99,2.49,1.24,0.00,1.24,4.23,1.24,1.74,1.00,0.00,4.98,1.24,1.00,1.49,0.25,1.00,3.23,13.18,1.74,16.92,3.98,5.22,8.21,2.74,1.00,0.50,1.49,0.00,0.00,2.24,1.49,0.00,0.25,0.25,0.25,13.93,6.22,0.75,0.00,0.00,0.50,0.00,0.00,0.50,3.73,1.49,0.75
4524,2870u5,4790,1402829818,SuicideWatch,Fuck school.,"So I'm in Year 11 right now (Australia) and as of lately, my marks and grades have gone down substantially. I know it's my fault, as I dread having to study more and more nowadays, and I deliberately put off revision because I'm a lazy piece of shit. I recently got 3/15 for an English task, purely because I hate English with a burning passion and it's the only compulsory subject in school, and my parents found out and are trying to get me help but I don't want it. I feel too lazy too even improve myself.As well as this, next year I have to undergo the HSC (the big exam in Year 12 to end my time in high school) and that is putting me off even more. I have friends in Year 12 who are preparing for it right now and they told me that they have 10 essays to do in the space of a few days. Hearing this made me freak out, knowing that I'll have to push myself to do that much work this time next year.The main thing about this is that school is making me feel suicidal. Not the social aspect of it, because that is going well for me at the moment. Just all the workload. I don't want to have to spend all my time studying for my subjects. I like everything I do besides English, and my parents have forced me into Advanced English, which I constantly tell them but they never listen. I feel like killing myself before my life gets too busy and I never have enough time for anything. Also, if I don't do well in the HSC next year, it can prevent me from getting a good university degree, and then that ends up with me having no job, and having no money. My worst fear is the fear of not being to support myself in the future, all because I'm a lazy shit.I haven't planned ending it, but the thought of next year makes me want to.TL;DR: School work (especially the English subject) and future life makes me think of killing myself.",364,33.03,8.06,96.11,7.03,28.00,12.91,91.76,59.34,20.05,13.74,12.64,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.10,6.32,5.22,13.74,9.34,5.49,7.97,2.75,17.58,4.95,3.02,0.55,1.65,2.47,6.04,2.20,3.85,0.82,1.37,0.00,4.12,0.55,0.27,0.00,0.00,10.44,2.20,2.47,1.37,0.82,2.20,1.92,1.65,0.00,0.55,1.10,1.65,0.55,0.82,0.27,0.00,7.97,1.37,2.47,1.92,1.65,1.10,1.37,14.01,1.65,16.21,1.65,5.77,8.79,3.85,0.00,0.00,0.55,0.00,0.82,1.65,0.82,0.00,0.00,0.82,0.00,14.29,4.67,4.40,0.27,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.75,1.65,0.27

I was the one who sat with you day after day when your first girlfriend broke up with you. I was the one who gave you advice as to why you shouldnt keep talking to her. I was the one you would spend nights crying with when you were down. i was the one who slapped you around and made you feel better when she came into your mind. As for you, I was the one who would risk his job to go cheer up, i would buy you your favorite snack. Voltage mountain _PERSON_, Watermelon sour patch kids and _PERSON_.

Normally I can take a hit like that and not be rattled to the bones, but the way she did it. She called me a liar when I asked if I could explain. She said that she wouldn't believe me even if I did. She scolded me like a child and it whipped me right back to when I was a kid and listening to my mom berate me.The way I grew up gave me a little PTSD that I cope pretty okay with, but fuck. When I trigger, I'm lost. It's game over. I turn into a mess.My husband took a break from his work to come have lunch with me since we work in the same area and I couldn't stop crying.I wanted to stop, I want to suck it up and bury it all away, but I can't. This is one gigantic problem that could get me fired.I was one medication for the longest time, and it was going great, then I got pregnant and had to stop taking everything and I'm starting to think that this is an absolutely horrible idea.My husband tried to calm me down, but nothing was really working, people were trying not to stare, but they were.Towards the end he broke down a little too and explained that this pregnancy was a horrible idea.He pointed out that at some point I'm going to check out and he's going to be left taking care of me and I know he loves me, and I know he's probably right. It just hurt so bad.I'm bringing a child into this world and I can't even take care of myself. I am probably going to be so mental checked out when I get older that I'm not even going to see my child be a productive member of society, saying I don't fuck up.My husband is going to be left holding everything while I pretty much check out of life.So I'm sitting here thinking about all the ways I could die. To save him from having to do any of that.but I can't. I can't do anything because I know how bad it would hurt him. I love my husband. I just. . I don't want to be alive anymore.I'm tired of fighting every day. I'm tired of waking up and hearing that voice remind me how much of a fuck up I am.I'm tired of everyone around me treating me like shit because they don't know what's going on, and the few people that do know what's going on don't know how to help me.I am tired of my management singling me out because I'm 'bad'.I'm tired of being called a liar even though I have no fucking clue what I'm lying about.I want out.I don't want to be the responsible one anymore, I don't want to be strong anymore.I tried and I can't do it. I don't have a support structure to turn to. I've never had one. I don't even know who to reach out to for help, especially at work because I don't trust my management.. . . I just can't do it and it hurts so much. I want to stop crying. I want to stop living.Just till I can be on my medication again.

I wouldn't have any issue pulling the trigger and ending it's life out of a position of love and caring. I have killed birds in the past who were on the verge of death. I'm not the sort of person who is crying out for attention or hates myself. I love myself, more than anyone else in the world. I want to see myself do well, I want to see the future me.

It's something I need to approach and work on for sure. I'm aware of that. but to work on something, we need respite. I can't work on an issue when I am being bombarded by it. I've been given a council flat, but it is a converted house and the floorboards above have been replaced with fibreboard. It is literally like being under a stage or a wrestling ring. even if the upstairs neighbour isn't slamming windows or slamming doors or dropping stuff on the floor, etc, just walking about causes a huge racket. I've been stuck here for 7 months already. I'm an introductory tenant so I can't just swap with somebody. I have to wait another 5 months before I gain that right. I live 3 miles from my family and friends and have no transport. There is nothing round here, not even a convenience store. I don't have spare money to call a taxi and go to a club or whatever. I have nowhere else to go. I am stuck in this flat. It's the only place I can make my food, check my emails, watch any movies or play games etc. I'm trapped and being bombarded by noise. I found somebody who wants to swap with me and this has been my sole focus. if I can get somebody to swap and convince the council to let me, then I can be saved. but recently I've been trying to put paperwork through, I have a doctors note and everything. what if they say no? I don't know if I can cope with any more. Is there anything I can do. Is there some way I can somehow get rid of the noise or some way to cope somehow...

Almost everyone close to me has betrayed me at one point or another. Some of my closest friends that knew everything that there is to know about me have turned their back without a second thought. Then walked back into my life like nothing was wrong.This has caused me to become paranoid to near homeless person with tinfoil hat levels. Every day I wake up and I force a smile on my face because I know If I show one iota of depression they'll get mad at me. I live my life to please my friends, and in the process, I am not pleased.Then we come to the topic of a girl, I'll call her ""E."" I can't express my feeling for E. She's been in my life for 3 years and has drastically improved it, but not completely pulled me out of my dark hole. I live even more to make her happy.

No matter how hard I try I just don't seem to be the son my dad wants me to be. I can *never* please him. Thanks to emotional abuse from my mother its an internal battle just to tell my dad that I love him. Even though I could say it to E within an instant.

I think four months later than I was expecting? Anyway... I just... I'm in a hole. I come to you guys to get out of that hole, and I do, but then I just fall into another _PERSON_ trap and impale myself on more depression. I... I'm used to the depression at this point. If I wake up and I'm genuinely happy, I feel like there's something *wrong* with me. I have some very important people in my life, and I try so hard to please them... its when I can't that these thoughts come back... I guess I should describe every stab in the chest for you guys to understand the full effect...There's my older sister _PERSON_. She and I aren't related by blood, but by bond. So... A few years ago when we first met up she and I kinda... fell in love. But I was an idiot, I found I loved her so much as a sister that loving her more was kinda awkward... And by the time that I realized I _PERSON_ love her more than a sister she... she started dating one of my friends. She's... twenty two now... I think... Five or six years older than I am. And we've known each other for... three years I believe. And... I just... I love her so much but I can't stand her at the same time... does that make any sense? Probably not. Essentially, I love her still. That's my issue, when I fall in love, I don't fall OUT of love... Anyway. I love her and she's still with _PERSON_... I think he's... eighteen or nineteen now. Anyway. _PERSON_... makes her cry a lot. Gives her fears. And she still loves him. He doesn't mean to do it, he's not a bad guy. But now he's talking about becoming a fireman and moving her up to Boston with him (she prefers long distance relationships) and all this that and another and she's terrified. She cries on the phone with me all the time because she's so scared. And seeing her like that... knowing things would be different if she just went out with me stabs me in the chest so hard. I want her to be happy more than anything but sometimes I feel like I should be doing something better to help her out instead of just being so filled with envy and remorse.Then there's Elaine. I've known her just about a year longer than I have _PERSON_. She's Sixteen and gorgeous. She's pulled me from the pit of depression more times than I can count. I wouldn't be here to ask for another plea of help if it wasn't for her. The reason she depresses me is... I'm guilty about loving her too. I fell in love with her... basically when I first saw her. She's gorgeous, smart, funny, random, hyper. Everything she is, I love. There's not a damn thing in her I would change. I would kill myself willingly if it would make her smile... But she doesn't love me the same way. She loves me as her best friend. I think I'm her most important friend, but she probably doesn't gauge her friends. I try not to ... but I do anyways cause I'm a horrible person. Anyway... I'm guilty for loving her because she doesn't feel the same. And so I make her sad all the time because since she doesn't feel the same she feels like she's not good enough to make me happy. Its a cycle, her and I. She feels good when I feel good and tries to keep me feeling good. I feel good when she feels good and I try to keep her feeling good. When one of us is down, we both are. She's the only reason I've been alive this long...Then there's my dad. Last but not least. He's twenty years older than me. And... His reason for me being depressed is simple. He. Can't. Help. It kills him inside and it kills me inside because of it. I try so hard to be a good enough son for him. I try so hard to make him proud of me but when I take off my ""mask of happiness"" and show him how I'm really feeling he gets angry because he can't help me. He tries, god he tries. But he just can't, he never had these issues, he doesn't understand. So yeah... those are my three main things bringing me down. Also the fact that I'm physically unable to make myself happy. When I do, I feel vain. I feel selfish. I feel greedy and horrible and that all pulls me back down into depression...I have plenty of ways of offing myself... sometimes I feel like the world would be happier without my presence bringing them down...

5700,z2ghj,7185,1346313195,SuicideWatch,I'm just... done.,"Well... it's finally over. I'm just done with life. Done with any hope of being successful or happy. Done with any hope of becoming something important, or useful. Let's start with the most recent problems, and then move on to those that will effect my future forever.A girl broke my heart, Reddit. I know what you're gonna say ""Oh you're 16 you're so young you'll find someone new."" _PERSON_. I waited for a chance with her for six years, helped her through the end of three relationships, had her admit that if I asked her out in person when she was single I'd probably get a shot, and she STILL said no. Do you have any idea the level of betrayal I felt from that? Do you have any idea how hurt I am? I wasted six years, broke four hearts, and rejected three girls because I thought I had a *chance* with her. And in the end, I just got my heart broken. Because of that I'm considering Celibacy and or, well, suicide.More important reasons: I'm probably not going to graduate high school. I fucked off my freshman/sophmore years and now I'm paying for it. I think all in all I have like... six credits? MAYBE? If I don't graduate I can't get into a good college and become a high school science teacher like I've dreamed of. This is all assuming after I fail High school I plan to get a GED. I don't know what I'll do with myself if I fail, I already feel like I have no place in life. Any chance at counseling was either awful, or taken from me. In the Awful case, the counselor had no interest in me at all, only the money my mother was giving her as a requirement because my school deemed me ""unsafe to myself and or others."" I don't really know, I was kicked out of 7th and 8th grade, so I guess I never even graduated elementary school. In the case that was taken from me, I finally met a counselor that I connected with, shared values with, and felt like I could really get used to. Then my Dad pulled me out of the counseling office she worked at because he ""Felt like she wasn't helping, and was making things worse.""My mother, who I moved back with after a year of living with my dad for the aforementioned girl above, is controlling and has decided that I will do everything her way, or else she'll kick me on the street.

5752,1wmjbi,14614,1391147130,SuicideWatch,Soulmates never Die,"From the beginning. I met a someone, lets call them _PERSON_ was the most amazing kind of perfect. S was everything I wanted in someone and I actually had the strength to tell S how I felt about S, unusual for me as I'm a shy person. Luckily S did not deny me. S and I were together all the time. Everyday we had the option we took it. S had a problem though, and I think I kind of noticed it, and in some way I want to help _PERSON_ may be paranoid, along with other mental things, S has been hurt and has a sad past. I did my best to make S happy, I was happy knowing I could make S happy. I had a problem. Life was boring, I didn't want to die, maybe meeting S showed me it was an option, but I never wanted to take it. I knew if I died, S would follow as S was probably suicidal. Sometimes I'd go to S at 2am because S was in trouble, with S or S's problems coming back to haunt _PERSON_ But S was getting better, the emptiness S had been feeling for so long, was going away, and I was happy I could be S's help, S's love. But then, S had to leave. S was taken away, 7128km back to S's original home. And we knew that at some point S would have to go home, but we both knew that we had never had this kind of relation, with anyone, we had to keep each other until we could be with each other, so we held on, even if we knew we had to wait. But since S has been gone, S has gotten back to S's old self. S is sad, depressed. S can't feel joy again. I try, I try so hard to make S happy, tell S things will be okay. S's mother is wrong and hurtful, S's friends are lies and somewhat against her. I talk to S whenever I can, but S has become distant, and wont talk to me. Seems too busy with her sadness. And S knows S is doing it, S will even say things like ""I'm so mean"" and ""I'm sorry, I'm not being nice to the one I love most"". I understand that what S does isn't because S want's to, but because S doesn't know what to do. Maybe S doesn't want to die, but I think S doesn't find happiness from anything, maybe just S finds it a waste when S will just die anyway. At this point, S's attitude is making me feel the same. I love S, and I don't matter, everything I did was for S, but now S is so far away and I can't help S like I did before. I worry for S because S is my future. We have plans to be with each other when both our worlds end. So, what should I do? How can I help S? What do I say to someone so empty they've lost the ability to listen to someone they love? I can't lose S, I mean, If S didn't want me anymore S would tell me, S is like that, and I would leave S because S wouldn't need me anymore. But thats not the case, S is becoming numb and I don't need help, I need to help _PERSON_ I don't think I'm depressed anyway. Maybe, but I know I'd be happy If I knew S was. S is all I have left, I hate to say this because It puts so much pressure on _PERSON_ We need to make it 7 months so I can visit S, I need to help S make it this far. Things are starting to lose meaning.

Now I've been fighting tooth and nail and trying is not enough.  I still can't wake up on time and work towards my goals.  None of the rage, guilt, sadness, is enough fuel to push me from where I am to a place where can have any sort of autonomy.  I can't do anything for myself and my sleep habits and dietary habits show it.  When I plan to go to my college and practice piano and guitar all day, I sleep in and can't bring myself to go at all.  The frustration is unbearable, yet it isn't enough to lift me from where I am.  I know the only way out of depression ultimately not from the help of others but from doing it myself, but I simply can't.My personal relationships are evaporating.  I treat my older brother like crap constantly, even though he's had a much more painful life than myself.  I don't feel his love, or the love of my family or friends.  I'm unwilling or unable to register the emotions and I cannot return them.  If life were a novel, I would not be the main character, I would be the antagonist, given the same circumstances as the protagonist, but without love.  I feel rotten and violent.  I cut off a friend of mine because seeing the way everyone loves her and flocks to her makes me sick.  She's extroverted, has lots of supportive friends, and isn't very bright; my polar opposite.  I have no reason to hate her other than that she reminds me of all the things that I am not.  I grew up without empathy and I've hurt so many people without even realizing it.  I've never been able to communicate my emotions to others or be honest.  I've been dealt a very good hand and my problems would be trivial compared to eviction, physical danger, or lack of prospects. I'm in my 5th year in college after changing schools and majors, and decaying from a 3.8 in Mechanical Engineering to a 1.x taking two liberal arts classes a semester.  My only way out is applying to a conservatory and doing a full 4 years.  The dept chair knows I am talented and I can even get a full ride, but I just don't have it in me to experience 4 more years of pain and risk mediocrity and failure again.  Even as an accomplished professional doing something I ""love"" I may not be physically capable of happiness. I am the universe experiencing itself and I can't even feel the joy while walking through the park on a sunny day.  I am not even fulfilling the minimum requirement of life, experiencing the world as it turns.  I'm beginning to think that I have chosen death over life, not in a literal sense, but in that I am unwilling to help myself and experience the world and it really is my responsibility.  Death seems logical because I'm exhausting the resources of everyone around me and it is doing nothing.  I am too stubborn to simply exist in a form beneath my potential and now that I have quit smoking weed there is no escape for me, no way to feel peace.  I'm not planning on offing myself now, but I can no longer see anything else in my future but nonexistence.

6158,xqdhy,12716,1344204209,SuicideWatch,Family are driving me to the breaking point.,"I've been depressed probably for over 6 years, but only diagnosed 2 years ago. I recently turned 19, and of the same day my mother kicked me out of the house because I stayed up too late at night and it kept her awake (though partly true, I know most of it was a lie as she would make up times that she saw me awake). I went to live with my father, which was good for about 3 weeks, in which time I have found online courses which I plan to take, planned to move to a Scandinavian country for a little while after getting a job and I had generally sorted my life out (bar getting a job). During this time, however, I tried going back to my mothers to show her I have changed three times. Each time before getting a chance to prove it, she would accuse me of not changing at all. This made me feel really f***ing annoyed as I have changed so much in such little time, and they she doesn't even care for the risk of her 'sleeping' pattern. Apparently she used to be depressed also so I would have thought she would understand... Obviously not.So anyway, I was meant to sort out applying to a course yesterday with my father at the _PERSON_, but then I backed out as I know there are plenty more course online that are just as good and free/cheaper (a thank you to /r/programming for finding them). So I told him this, and he was skeptical but didn't mind.Later on in the evening I was asking my sister if she could give me a lift somewhere (she lives with my mother full time, never sees my dad) and she said that my mother could do it. I said after the three times of trying to change I am not willing to see her. This is when she goes all hypocritical *'you're disgusting for not seeing your mother'* on me, before telling me my mother is the best thing to have happened to me and I should 'open my eyes'.This extremely offended me as it was so hypocritical that she never sees her dad, so I explained to her my thoughts and then told her she should open up her eyes, or at least her heart to see him a few times a month. She then accused me of starting arguments and won't speak to today.Now today - my father is getting annoyed as I haven't applied for one of the courses yet and says time is running out. Thing is I have over a month to apply for these courses, but I still plan to by the end of this week. After telling him this he still got annoyed and said it was too soon.Then there is my _PERSON_, my mother's mother, who lives next door to my father (yea weird I know). She's always phoning me on my mobile and telling me to say sorry to my mother, despite not knowing what I have done. She hasn't even been told my mother kicked me out. If I didn't have respect for elders, or people in general, then I ould have told her to _PERSON_.So basically, story ends here, end of rant, two days ago I was the happiest in a long time. This evening I'm now considering either applying for the course or just killing myself. I don't want to, and I'm flipping scared of death, but I see it as the only way to get away from all this bollocks I've put up with.",608,29.69,32.85,88.24,16.38,32.00,11.51,95.07,61.02,21.55,16.78,11.02,0.00,0.49,4.93,0.33,4.61,4.11,15.30,8.72,6.74,8.06,2.30,20.56,5.59,3.62,0.99,1.32,1.97,3.95,1.48,2.14,0.33,0.99,0.49,12.50,2.80,0.00,5.92,1.81,12.34,2.63,1.32,1.81,2.47,1.64,3.95,2.80,1.64,0.99,0.16,1.81,0.82,0.82,0.00,0.16,4.28,0.16,0.99,1.48,1.81,0.16,6.74,10.03,1.64,17.27,1.97,6.09,9.54,1.48,0.33,0.33,0.33,0.00,0.33,0.66,0.16,0.33,0.16,0.00,0.16,16.45,4.44,4.61,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.16,0.00,3.29,1.64,2.30
6206,18nnxn,12716,1361050576,SuicideWatch,Suicide is quickly becoming the only option.,"I have nothing in my life. I do nothing with my life. I am a waste of space. All I do is sit in front of a computer all day and eat. I'm living with my father, but the only contact I have with him is when I go down to get food. He treats me like shit but it's the only place I can live. My mother kicked me out after she started an argument with me after I told he I feel suicidal. ""How do you think I feel having to raise you,"" and shit like that. She shouted at me endlessly whilst I tried to stay calm, at which point I left. I went to my father's house and attempted to cut my wrists, but I barely managed to bleed. I had written a suicide note too. After about 3 hours of listening to music my mother somehow gets in the house and finds me trying to cut. I just got up and left telling her to fuck off, then went for a walk in the local woods for about 6 hours. I contemplated jumping off a 40-60ft cliff but the amount of dog walkers put me off. I went home, then me and my father got my things from my mothers house and took them up here to where I am now. It's a fucking shit hole, I've tried to clean up but he carries on being a fucking scrub. He gets massively infuriated over trivial things (e.g I said I would be able to make us both lunch in 10 minutes rather than straight away. He goes batshit). I want to move down to my Mother's house as it is a much nicer environment (despite her being a massive cunt also) but I'm not allowed to unless I apologise for what I wrote in the suicide note she found. It essentially said how my parents are the fuel for my depression and I backed it up with examples of how the treat me, things they do, etc...I went to the Doctors, and they tell me I need a job. (I'm 19, btw). When I dropped out of college for ""being lazy"", which only my physics teacher understood to be depression and listened to me at the time, I did some volunteer work, followed by working in a Super Market. I would say I was getting better, but when my work contract ended at the Super Market I turned down the offer to carry on there, and quit the volunteer work as I was far worse than before. When at the Doctors, my parents say their side of the story and I never get a chance to speak, so to them I'm just a bit depressed. I can't even motivate myself to do things I want to do. I sit at a computer all day being told all I do is play video games. Nope. I do nothing. I can't motivate myself to play games. I love mountain biking, but I can't motivate myself to go riding. My friends are awesome, but I can't motivate myself to go to the pub for a few hours. I can't even motivate myself to go out with the girl I like, she knows I've had ""mental problems,"" and she has had some too, but I can't tell her why I don't meet her because I don't want her to think I'm making excuses not to see her.So, I have nothing. I am nothing. I have no education to do the jobs I want to do. The one job I do want to do (and the ONLY thing I am motivated in the slightest for) I'm ""not allowed to do"" as it's ""not a real job."" I want to try, but my parents are holding me back.

6326,2ltin9,12083,1415585835,SuicideWatch,I'm close to making my second attempt [m 22],"I don't really know how to open this letter.By all marks, measures, and standards I live a pretty good life. My family lived the ""American Dream"" going from rags to upper-middle class riches; and I'm already primed to go even further than that. I have a huge family circle, and 7 really close friends. I have my own place, own my car, make very good money, do close to the job I've wanted since I was a teenager. Hell, I almost have enough in the bank to pay off my student loans and I just graduated in May.But it means piss all.It might not make sense, but none of these things mean anything to me. They are all items, people, and futures for somebody else.I'm completely alone in the universe. Everything I have, Everybody I know, is connected to a fake identity I created after my first (obviously failed) attempt.The only person who knows a part of who I actually am is my _PERSON_ (whom I left when I moved away from college).Dealing with these feelings was easier in college because I didn't have any real responsibilities. I'm smart enough to coast through most classes while asleep, and I can earn any amount of money any time I want using my skills (I'm a very in demand programmer).But now it's not nearly as easy. I've lost my friends to various parts of the country. Lost my family to their's and my time and schedules. And I threw away the best person in my life because the physical distance between us was too much.The reason I'm writing this is because today my _PERSON_ came over to see me. We're still best friends after the breakup and I've admitted to still having feelings for her, but I looked into her eyes and there were only dead coals where her love for me used to shine.She had completely moved on and nothing was left.It was the last straw. I was a camel trudging my way through an endless desert with a mountain of cargo 10 years tall and that was the final feather that caused me to buckle.One of the last two people in the world I cared for no longer cared about me.The only reason I'm here writing this instead of drowning myself or OD'ing on sleeping pills is because it would destroy my mother if I died.

My age is irrelevent because I've met 18 year olds and 60 year olds with the same life experiences. All of my life I have simply wanted to be good person a good man.  I wanted to be a loving father a good husband. I love everyone but it has become harder to do so.  Through the years ive had pleanty of great experiences and pleanty of bad ones. My two yolder ex step brothers used to molest each other daily force me to watch, to join in. Ive seen the deterioration of my family from unstable parents who would jump from hone horrendous partner to the next. At times ive been blamed for the downfall of a few simply because I was shocked at how they acted and my lack of suprise in there ending. At 13 its sad to hear that your  the reason your father acts out or is deppresed.  One of my parents have finally latched on to a religious zealot of a person. Never before had my family been religious untill they met.I am appalled at the shear audacity and hatred ""loving cristians"" can have towards one another especially there family. My sisters have become devoted followers  and I have been ostrisized for not blindly excepting there faith. To give you some example my sister was pregnant before marriage because of this my parents didnt talk to her didnt let my other younger sisters talk or see her. She eventually got married and to the man so they began to speak with her again. When the man started to abuse her cheat on her and get her intoxicated to film her she had decided to leave him. My parents and there church made it clear that agian she would lose her ties with them and she couldnt do it. Unfortunately they are still together trying for 5 kids.I have recently been engaged. She left me 1 month before the wedding. Ive never felt so alone until then.I have attempted suicide before and through my fails I have learned to perfect the act.Through my deppresion and self loathing I have developed a hate for people and I cannot do it anymore.Now I already have the day chosen and the means in wich I will do it. Ive already started the steps for this. I write this today not for me but for anyone elce. Ive been alone my whole life and through my lonlieness I have sought suicide and will forever be lonepy no more.

Loaded, cocked. I'm usually careful and mind where it's pointing at all times but it must've slipped my mind. It had been pointing in the general area of my heart for hours.

7159,1pquj1,25040,1383393405,SuicideWatch,"I'm probably not as bad as some here, but I think I need a little help","I tell everyone I'm fine. I'm not. A small part of my story is here. It pretty much describes my life as of now. I originally posted this in an Askreddit thread, but omitted a vital detail due to not wanting to start an argument. I'm a Christian. Which makes it worse. I have a strong addiction to computers, so strong I can almost faintly feel a physical bond between it and I. If anyone gets between that, I get very hostile and upset to the point of breaking good down completely. The main problem is gaming my life away. A few others are wanting friendship, freedom, and removing myself from my turmoils life. You might say that it's normal, especially for a 17 year old male. But when it gets to the point that I completely fail a college course, you know it's bad. Why? I was gaming and the teacher gave me 30 min to correct the test and I simply said that I'm not near a PC. To make that worse, I had accidentally submitted another students work as he sent it to me for studying so I could better know what the course required. So the college pretty much saw me as a cheat, and further supporting that is the fact that I refused to try fix it. I have also been struggling with, um, fapping for well over 5 years. I feel horrible everytime I do it but I can't stop. The temptation is too great. I tell myself that I'll feel better after, but it's just a huge lie I tell myself. I finally talked to my dad about it, but that seemed to make it worse. He was forgiving, but disappointed. I spun a web of lies and deceit throughout the whole year about gaming and my PC. It all finally came out a few weeks ago, but I don't feel any better. The punishment was removal of my laptop and PC for an indefinite amount of time. So you can imagine how I feel as my computers were/are a gateway to friends and a better place. My whole life for the past 6-7 years has been a mess. I just want it to end, maybe when I'm 18 it will. Recently though, I've been close to suicide. My parents seem to brush it off as if I don't know what I'm talking about and that my life is okay, you just need time to iron it out. It's been so long though, I think I would have sorted it all out some time ago. I've been in the kitchen in the wee hours of the morning, holding a knife ready to take it all away. I think the only reasons I haven't, is that it would be selfish and my family would miss me, and that I'm afraid. I don't know what will come after for sure. So I have continued to plod it out, hoping that the newt day will be better. But it never is. I either fall into depression over my lost computers, or fap in the shower. I'm so sick of it all.

7824,188jqk,46549,1360479069,SuicideWatch,20 M losing hope that this will ever get better.,"To preface:  I've been clinically depressed for years.  Been on countless medications (sometimes the doctor took me off sometimes I just stopped taking them).  _PERSON_ once (last year about this time) for five days because I was ruled a danger to myself before being released to go live with my family.  Stay with them for a couple months before deciding to drop out of the college I couldn't afford and start working an hour from my family in the city I grew up in, living with four friends.So here's my mindset:  To sum it up in a word I would say ""dispair"".  Every morning I wake up and wonder why I hadn't ended it the night before to save myself the agony of facing another day.  I mean I'm doing ok in the appearances department (ie. job, friends, on good terms with most my family, a place with buddies, and am active in a local theater company) but noone seems to understand that while I can see these positives  I can go a minute without thinking of a different way I could kill myself.  Nothing makes me happy anymore I might feel a spark of cheerfulness every now and again but I cant help but see the world and life as pointless.  I hate it when people ask well do you know how you'd kill yourself.  At any moment in time I have infinite was I could do it and I'm creative enough to think/daydream about a lot of them.  Two days ago I found myself researching different methods effectiveness, pian levels, and speed.  It scares the fucking shit out of me that I can't control these emotions or thoughts and the only reason I've been holding on is because I don't want to fuck up my younger siblings or allow my roommates to find my body.  I realize that second option could be easily remedied but I feel that if I reach that point it will be the most spiritual and intense moment of my life and I would want to be somewhere I felt safe and comfortable.  I've tried talking with my roommates about these topics but don't get much of a response.  I know they don't know the extent of my depression but they do recognize that I'm not getting out of bed until after 3pm on an almost daily basis.  When we first moved in together I explained as best I could my depression and warning signs from the past that I should not be left to my own devices (and have discussed since then).  The person who is closest to understanding where I am is my mother and after my hospitalization last year she in a way almost seems scared of me and I feel like the thought that rolls through my head constantly has invaded hers and shes wondering if maybe her son cant be fixed.  I don't want to hurt the people that have done their best to help my through the years but it only ever gets worse.  I'm tired of these thoughts and daydreams being in my head.  I need them to come within my at least somewhat control or I'm going to crash and burn.Thanks for reading my textual vomit and complete pity party.",547,41.80,14.45,99.00,17.76,28.79,15.54,94.33,58.50,19.56,14.99,12.25,0.18,0.55,0.73,1.28,4.39,5.30,14.81,9.69,4.20,7.68,2.38,20.11,5.12,3.29,1.10,1.28,2.01,6.22,2.74,3.29,0.37,1.10,1.10,7.50,1.10,0.91,0.73,0.18,16.45,4.94,2.56,2.56,4.02,1.10,3.66,1.83,0.55,0.18,1.10,3.11,0.91,1.83,0.37,0.00,7.50,2.56,1.10,2.38,1.65,0.91,3.66,13.53,0.73,17.73,1.46,7.31,9.14,1.28,0.91,1.10,0.00,0.18,0.37,0.91,0.55,0.00,0.18,0.18,0.00,11.15,4.02,1.28,0.37,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.37,3.11,1.46,0.55

Well now, who really knows?  For like the changing of the seasons  Sense comes and goes.

Holidays are over so everyone will have gotten one last show out of me if they wanted it. Work is starting to wind down for a bit again and all of my projects are pretty much a mess because I simply can't be assed to give a shit anymore. I never heard back from the psychiatrists office that I called and at this point I'm not even sure I'd want their help. I have no one to talk to about this anymore as I threw a tantrum at my therapist a while back and now she wont let me make an appointment until I'm on some meds. I'd see a doctor and talk to a therapist one last time if they were willing, but it really appears they aren't.I ordered my supplies, they should be here sometime next week. At that point I'll be able to pick a day. No mistakes this time. No one to pull me out of my car. No one to ""save"" me back into this life that I just don't want anymore. I know its not painful, even if it is a bit scary. Just a few labored breaths and some panic feeling. All of that goes away quickly though. I don't know how quickly I passed out the last time, but it was FAST. Less than two minutes if I had to guess. I found out from an old friend that I had attempted suicide in 8th grade. I don't remember doing it, but he claims I took the razor out of a pencil sharpener and tried to slash my wrists. Of course it didn't work but, if true, it means that my upcoming attempt will be my 5th. This one has to stick. It just has to. I could not deal with another botched attempt. I could not deal with another failure. I could not deal with the hospital again.I just don't get it. I don't get why people enjoy being alive. Sure there are good things but most of the time even when I'm trying to make myself enjoy things that I know I should I just feel numb. It doesn't matter what I try or what I do. I've tried a dozen different medications from two doctors, three different therapists, adjusting my diet, adjusting my activity level, adjusting my sleep and pretty much trying every remotely realistic sounding thing that might make me feel better. Nothing does. I'm exhausted by life. I can't wait for my packages to ship so I can finally figure out when my life will end.Just needed to get this out of my brain.

8327,1jwu1n,17119,1375910974,SuicideWatch,Why should I stay alive?,"Ok. So here's the thing. I have a broken spine. It's not as bad as to be on a wheelchair but not as good as to let me walk more than a few meters without pain. I spend almost all day in bed because of this and can barely walk around the house. I've been depressed most of my life an since I can remember. I got kicked out of college because I wouldn't go to classes because of social anxiety. I tried Photography School after that but since that requires walking I couldn't complete a semester. There's this doctor who told me of a new surgery but I don't have any money since I can't work because I can't walk. I live in my mothers house and she's practically the only reason I haven't committed suicide yet (I have tried once). I don't see a very bright future for me. I'm 25 and I feel like my live has been o pause for 7 years. Now I spend my days on a bed with a throat/ear infection I can't cure because I have no money, I don't shower anymore because I feel there's no need to, I don't go outside because I can't walk for long and I don't take my depression meds because I don't want to ask my mother to buy me some more when I finish them. Nevertheless, why is everybody asking me to stay alive? Why won't people just let me die? I live a life of pain all the time so why should I stay alive? I won't do anything special for the world or something and I don't think my death would change a thing for anybody. I hate myself, my life, my body, etc. I wish I had sleeping pills like I used to. That was my choice of suicide. Anyway, just wanted to vent. I really don't think anything in this world would make me happy and someday I'll have enough courage to try again and finally do it and die. I mean, why should I care for the feelings of others about me dying? It's not like they can feel my pain or help me with it.

My friend told them that I was going to kill myself on Sunday; ""*was*"", as in ""not anymore"", because I now have to wait a bit longer.I had to explain my entire situation, all of my suicidal emotions to 3 counselors whom I consider strangers. All 4 years of depression, and 2 of being hated by about one thousand people my age.

I'm content with my death, and unbeknownst to me until now, that's not totally normal.My mom was called in, and from the sound of her voice and the look on her face, she was crying before she came in.

It makes me wish I had done this all in secret.My friend, Christina, who told everyone, expected me to be angry. During the talk, she texted me saying ""I'm sorry. I love you."" I wasn't angry. I'm still not. I know she means well. If anything, I'm sorry I dragged her into this. I love her, too. I just wish it wasn't the romantic love that I feel, and a platonic one that she does.Midway while typing this post (everything before this), I was interrupted and dragged aside. I've just been given a speech about how I'm not really depressed, just a teenager. How I should get over the 2 years of torture. How the past needs to be forgotten easily. How everything I'm feeling isn't real. My mom and 2 of her close friends just explained how I'm supposed to immediately forget the past and every effect it's had on me.

While I was inside, I was able to let my Prozac take effect, and frankly... I hate it. It slows down my ability to think. Typically, I can multitask and handle 3 or 4 thought tangents at once. Now, I can only do 1. And my creative abilities have been halted, as well as my philosophical thinking. It also makes me genuinely *angry*. I get frustrated, sure, but never angry. _PERSON_ is just an absolutely disgusting emotion to me. It also makes sleeping harder and gives me extreme jitters, to the point where I'm not just unable to sit still, but that I begin to swing my arms around rapidly, start pacing, my legs shake furiously, tremors, etc.I did meet someone who shares my stance that suicide shouldn't be taboo in society and who also has no will to live. I've also learned that I *do* matter to people, but also that that fact doesn't bother me. If I die, people will be sad. That's a given. But I don't care anymore. They'll have to keep on living their lives without me. Maybe someone will be affected to the point that they are also diagnosed with depression and might find out what I have about my life and realize I'm not crazy.Well, I was released on the basis that I told my doctor whom I was assigned that I had no further thoughts of hurting myself and that I was no longer sad. All lies. I wanted to be let out and told them what they wanted to hear. In reality, I still want to die, but not because everyone will benefit, but because I'm tired of living. I could easily go through life as a semi-successful person and start a family. But I'd really rather not. I don't want to live for the sole reason that I've done more than I feel the need to have done.Yes, I'm only 15. Yes, I have a long, full life ahead of me. But I'd rather not live it. This isn't something that I'm up for. I have no reasons to live, as my life will only be a very bleak existence, as I'll never find happiness. It's a feeling that I've lost all contact with. I also don't feel that there will be anything to convince me that living is worthwhile.The only thing that's holding me from the rope now is that my parents have signed papers that say, while I'm under their legal custody, they will go to prison if I kill myself and that my younger brother will be tossed into the foster care system. After seeing the people in the institution, and what they've been through as foster kids, I couldn't do that to him. My parents also wouldn't last more than 3 days in prison.So, SW, until the day I'm standing on my own two feet, I'll be here.

8350,11ec5q,27624,1350095208,SuicideWatch,A salute to my friend '_PERSON_,"18 years old, about 5'6"", stocky build, medium-length curly black hair, and tan skin that comes from a mix of more ethnicities than I could keep track of. Always a calm look on his face; the greatest at hiding his emotions. Bisexual, but with a preference for guys, and, surprising at the time, Buddhist. Polite to everyone whose path he crossed, regardless of his opinion of them. Lived through hell as a child, and has gone so insane that he's become sane again. Protective of those he feels are prone to being bullied, as well as his family. His bucket list was simple: travel across 3 states; set up his younger sister with a path for a good life; and to buy a pack of cigarettes once he turned 18.So simple in desires, yet so complex to understand. But not for me. I understood him to the greatest extent that one could for only knowing him for the 1 week I was hospitalized. We found much common ground and felt a strong friendship in that time. We shared views on many things, such as politics, suicide, life as a whole, etc. I'm proud to say that I was friends with Jon.Monday, October 8th was his 18th birthday. He bought his pack of cigarettes on his own for the first time. On Wednesday, October 3rd, he was released from the hospital. He told me his plan to commit suicide at exactly 11:35 A.M. one week from his release: Wednesday, 10th. He told me that no matter what, nothing would stop him. He was at peace. He understood his importance to others, and that his family would collapse without an emotionally stable person (him), since his father killed his mother, and subsequently committed suicide when Jon was 8. He knew he was intelligent. He knew he would be able to survive the working world. But that didn't matter to him. He wanted only death.I regret not stopping him. Though I would never see him again, he's changed my life. Until the day he died, he helped people, even with his own problems to deal with. Though it tired him emotionally and physically, he kept helping. No matter what, he stood tall through his issues.

I haven't been taking my medication since I was discharged from the mental hospital I was in because I hate the side-effects on my mind. Even while they were working, I wanted nothing but death, so I decided to stop taking them. I missed my previous ""deadline"", but less than 3 weeks late isn't that bad.Many of you will tell me not to and say ""It will get better"", but that's just it: I don't WANT to get better. I don't WANT to overcome depression. I simply want to leave this world without having to mess up so many others' lives along the way. I also just don't have the motivation to keep doing *anything*. I have times where simply *speaking* requires far too much effort on my part. I also have the inability to keep putting my mask on throughout the day or to do even the simplest of things. Typing this is draining, as well.So, my reason for posting this is simple: 1.To at least have *someone* know what happened before I did anything, and 2.To tell anyone else with similar feelings that what I'm about to do is, by no means, a good idea. I doubt that you care how others will react to it if you're where I am now, but this might help. If you have depression, then try not to feel alone, because there are always people who love you. ALWAYS. You may not think so, but they do. Whether or not they show it is a personality-trait, but more people are ready to help you than you think.I'm sorry for wasting your time. My plethora of pills beckons. Death awaits me, his dark cloak looking warmer and more inviting than ever, like an old friend seeking a hug. Good luck to all of you. I'm sure that you all have more potential in life than I do, so try to put that to use. I believe in all of you.         -Much love, V",358,17.62,23.39,91.01,51.93,14.92,12.01,94.69,62.29,20.95,13.97,9.22,0.00,3.35,0.28,1.12,6.98,3.63,14.25,12.29,6.70,8.10,3.35,22.91,6.42,5.03,1.96,0.84,3.63,6.42,3.91,2.51,0.28,0.28,1.40,8.94,0.00,0.28,0.00,0.28,18.72,3.63,2.51,1.68,4.19,2.23,6.98,2.51,0.84,0.56,1.12,1.96,0.00,1.40,0.00,0.28,7.54,1.68,2.51,1.12,2.51,0.84,3.91,15.64,2.23,11.17,0.84,5.03,5.31,1.68,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.56,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.28,0.00,21.23,7.82,5.03,0.56,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.84,1.12,4.19,0.00,1.68

But, sadly, things didn't work out quite as I had hoped.I'll keep it short:First posted last Thursday, but my plans got delayed due to parents being present so I could't get to the pills. On Saturday night, I was able to get the pills. I took my mother's _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ (which I feel bad about b/c she might need them later), and my _PERSON_, and went to my bathroom. I laid out all the pills on the counter.*24 _PERSON_ (20 mg)*21 _PERSON_ (5-500 mg)*18 _PERSON_ (20 mg or 25 mg)*4 Tylenol PM*4 Melatonin71 pills. Seriously? I survived THAT? Fuck. I'm unfortunately resilient. 15 years old, 6'2"", 135 pounds, and 71 pills didn't even do any visible damage? Someone with a degree, please explain this annoying phenomenon to me.Anyways... I took those at around 9 PM, and went to bed an hour later. An hour after I went to bed, my parents came in to my room and asked me if I had taken the _PERSON_ from the medicine cabinet. I answered ""No,"" and told them to let me sleep. They kept pressing, so we went to the living room so as to not wake up my grandmother (she was sleeping in my brother's bed and he was in the living room). Once there, I told them what I had taken and said ""I'm trying to overdose, so I want to sleep through it."" We went into *their* bedroom so as not to freak out my 12 year old brother.Once there, my mom got some texts from my best friend _PERSON_. I had sent her messages on tumblr that said ""I'm sorry"", and ""I'm really sorry. Goodbye."" (My mom gave _PERSON_ her phone number for emergencies such as this one) I lied and told them I sent those because I felt bad for not being able to hang out with her much as of late, and had my mom tell her that. I called her and said ""It's fine, _PERSON_. It's all alright."" After that, my dad suggested that I make myself puke, to which I declined.After that, I have no recollection aside from a 10 second time frame. I was in my parents bed and the sun was shining through the blinds and my parents' friend came to check on me (I didn't recognize him at the time b/c I was high as fuck from the _PERSON_). He asked me something, and I replied with something that made no sense. He then said something else and left the room. Aside from that, I remember *nothing* from Sunday.I wake up at 9:38 AM and walk to the living room. Confused and still high, my mom says ""Good morning!"" in a way that you would speak to a young child. Even further confused, I said the same thing. She asked me if I knew what day it was, and it was already Monday. I was shocked, but only a little b/c I was also hallucinating from the _PERSON_, which hadn't left my system. I continued on with some small talk, then went to my room and sat at my computer. I was CLEARLY not going to be able to play _PERSON_, so I just listened to a few songs before deciding to go back to sleep. I wake up at 7 PM and join my family for dinner. From then on, no one brought up my OD.Although, my mom said that on Monday night, she stayed in my room to keep watch on me and informed me that my heart skipped a beat 20 times, every 20 minutes, and caused the jolt that you get when you start falling in a dream.Okay, maybe not as short as I thought. As a reward, (if you've gotten this far) you can ask me anything. If there's anything you want to know, I'm an open book.I'm alive.

From a suicidal attempt at nine, to again at 15, to again at 17. It all stems from my mother who suffers from alcoholism, something I've only recently accepted as a disease and not her fault. I can't say I'd feel comfortable being in the same room as her, but that's another story.Throughout my life I've tried telling the world I suffer from depression, or bipolar disease, or whatever the hell it's called today. But today I plan to. Actually, right after this post, somehow I've worked up enough courage to finally tell my father that at some point I didn't think life was worth living anymore. I don't know what his response will be, though, at least it'll be the most cathartic moment of my life. I've shared my story on Reddit before, only because I was afraid of the repercussions of unveiling this burden to people I know. The Internet is there to lend a hand, yes, but telling people anonymously is only the first step. You must accept that the freedom you seek, the freedom from an emotional burden that you've not experienced alone, is only one statement away.One simple conversation could change and prolong your life by an immeasurable amount. Depression won't disappear. It will linger inside until you tell someone or let it consume you whole. And I have reached that pinnacle of sadness multiple times, yet to bounce back.

I have a pretty strong survival instinct, and a few phobias that make it really hard to go through with it... but I'm creative enough that I could probably find a way around that.It's not that I don't have anything to live for, I'm actually pretty darn content with my life at the moment... but my issue is just that, the moment. Life was nothing but a damn struggle until now, it's still a daily struggle just to be me; and it looks like a fucking tough road ahead. I want to just give up, and say ""let the next person deal with that shit"". I guess my biggest issue is that I don't know if there is anyone who might deal with it.**STORY TIME!** So, I'm a trans* woman. A polyamorous transgender lesbian. (My dating pool sucks) Growing up was tough, school was tough, work sucks, people suck, and it's pretty much a fight with my own body and other peoples' assumptions every single day. I'd like to change that, to make it so that being transgender isn't such an odd issue. I'd like to stand up, and make sure that it's easier for the next person to follow after me; I really would. But it's fucking hard. I cry all the time, because people just can't see me for me, even though I've told them so many times who I am. My mother has rejected me, and I think she's dying... My family may have disowned me, I'm not sure if they'd tell me if they did; but they don't talk to me anyway and won't return my attempts to contact. I lose friends... and I don't know why. I've made a lot, and lost most of them. I try to be a good friend and good person, and everyone seems to say that we'll always be friends... but, ""always"" never lasts as long as I thought it should.I have a therapist and a safety net, and the moment I make any decisions I'll act accordingly. I'm just, not sure that this is something worth mentioning to them. (_PERSON_ sure that it would result in a lowering of my hormone treatment, which would be catastrophically devastating to my already low self-esteem) I've got everything I need to keep going, but the will and reason. Even if I made a huge impact, it wouldn't change anything... people would still make it fucking hard to be trans, or queer of any sort, in this world.I just, god... I'm so fucking tired of fighting. I guess, I'm glad that anyone might read this and listen. I'll update this tomorrow, or sooner as need be?

The reason I went off my medication is because my last doctor only gave me a three-month prescription, and then handed me off to another doctor who could handle my other meds better... but that doctor never contacted me, and i don't know how to contact them. So, in theory, i would just contact my doctor. I... have absolutely no reason for why I haven't done that, other than i just haven't. I haven't really done anything.Which brings us to the meat of the thing. I had a shitty childhood; and it's left me with serious depression and a lack of coping mechanisms. Luckily, after my last attempts, I got much needed help and can recognize my warning signs, and can rationalize against the feelings. there have been several times in the last few weeks that I knew I shouldn't be left alone, and I made sure that I wasn't. But now, in spite of everything I've been doing, I'm still having these feelings which should have gone away. i don't want them anymore, and I can't make it go away on my own.

I switched high schools between 9th and 10th grade because I hated it so much. My grades were good, but I admit I didn't really have to work for them. I was always told by the very few friends I had (read: usually my boyfriend at the time) that it got better after high school. I held on to that for the longest time. Fast forward, I'm in my 3rd year of college. I feel guiltier and more terrible than ever because I still have no friends and I feel like it's my fault. I have a boyfriend, one of the most supportive boyfriends I've ever had, but it's not fair for him to handle the burden that is my problems. To compare:High school - ate lunch in the bathroom stallCollege - eat lunch to-go in a corner of the library, in my apartment or not at allHigh school - Spent weekends at home sleeping to escape the hatred for myselfCollege - Spend weekends and anytime I'm not in a mandatory class at home sleeping or in the library hiding, on reddit or playing video gamesHigh school - was involved, knew how to fake a smileCollege - possibly regressed, can't even fake happiness anymore I feel like I'm just getting worse. I'm only 20 and I feel like I'm getting an ulcer and (LADIES ONLY; MEN SKIP DOWN) have bizarre cycles. I went without 'one' for a month and now I've been on 'one' for almost a month without a break. I literally cry every single day and have a breakdown every 2-4 days. Freshman year I would hang out on the top floor of the parking garage when I was depressed and lay out various medications about twice a semester, getting ready to end it. I haven't done that lately (only because I made a promise to the boyfriend, who has a small idea of how bad it really is) but I want to more than ever, almost daily, which he nor anyone else knows. I know I should go get help, but I'm having a terrible time getting over the stigma. :/ I'm still clinging to the hope that it just 'gets better'. I don't know what to do. I know the obvious is 'get help', but is there anything else I can do? I can provide more details if someone needs them.I know this is long, and I made it shorter once already, but this past week even getting out of bed or typing out a story like this drains me.

Nothing stops me from hating myself. Even though I realize that there are millions of people dying of hunger right now, it just doesn't stop me from hating my existence.I tried college, and I stopped going because I hated it. I hold a shitty job that pays nothing, working for people that couldn't give a shit if I died tomorrow. Every day I waste my time in this place, and every day I wish I would get hit by a truck on the way home. It's a pointless endeavor. I would try to find a new hobby but everything I try bores the living shit out of me or is costs money, and when you don't have any it's hard to find something to do. I don't have any friends I actually appreciate. I don't appreciate them because they are in the same position I am in, and being a working-class drone isn't a respectable position in my mind. Women drive me crazy. I thought I was in a picture perfect relationship that shit everywhere because it turned out that I lied to myself and made myself believed I loved a girl I didn't, yet, I still think about her every day. You'd say I still love her, but I wouldn't be content if I was in a relationship with her again. I would belittle her and take advantage of her anyway. I do my best to avoid relationships now because they seem to just get in the way of me trying to dig myself out of this shitpit that is my life, but no matter how much I focus on trying to get out of debt, it's never fast enough. No one is reliable. No one is dependable. No one has any fucking money. No one is industrious as I am and no one wants me around anyway so whats the fucking point? I'm fairly sure I've never actually felt love. All I have been able to do is fool myself into thinking I was in love. I haven't been able to feel happy since I left high school, and I'm forgetful as hell. I ask a lot of questions and always end up getting laughed at for asking questions that are obvious to everyone else, yet they always as me to come fix their bullshit when it breaks!I'm not motivated to do much of anything, ever. I'm already tired of writing this. I can't focus on fucking anything. I think I literally have a 30 second attention span, and then I just get frustrated because things are taking too long. The only constant in my life is feeling like shit, day in and day out, and when I don't, it's because I've convinced myself that feeling depressed is for weak people that can't get their heads screwed on the right way, but I'm pretty sure I'm the one that can't get his head screwed on the right way. I squandered all the money I made in the last 4 years on stupid shit that didn't make me any money back, and I still knowingly do it every day. My self control with money is like a child in a toys-r-us with mommy's credit card.  I hate myself because I can't be everything, and it's turning out it's hard for me to be anything at all.
