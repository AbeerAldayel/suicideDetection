Rant(m21),"I have a holiday coming up but after it I really feel like killing myself. Im 21 qnd a guy ans j have no friends or girlfriend(and never have and never will). I am ugly and feel intense social anxiety as well and depression. I see static all the time and have visual snow. I feel different from others and have always been socially awkward and isolated. I dont feel like I can have a normal life. All my friends are gone. I can sense it now, when someone isn't interested in a friendship in the same way i am, and when I pull away the friendship is over because it was always me that was initiating contact. They must have other friends they value more and have more fun with but i really valued being around themm. The only thing I enjoy is lifting weights and going to the gym, but thats not enough for a happy functional life. I genuinely want to die and thought about hanging myaeld every day for at least the last month( i journal now). 

The funny thing is, whayever people szy nkrmally doesnt help because i dont relate to people. I struggle to understand what they are saying or why they are feeling certain ways. Therapy feels uncomfortable because im shit at talking and expressing my feelings, i also lie about it because itz very sensitive.

How am I supposed to cope. Watching my wife's Facebook feed on New Years.,"Christmas was hard enough, but this is killing me.

My wife of 25 years left me two months ago. Spent a night with somebody she works with, and dumped me by text when I was away visiting family on my birthday. She's been secretive about her phone for a long time and is occasionally alcohol dependent and abusive. She has new male admirers flocking round her and is flaunting her new happy life on Facebook and posting things like ""She left her old life and stepped into her new life"" on Instagram.

I messaged her that I was really struggling earlier and got a reply that was just ""there is nothing to say"".

I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I'm nearly 50. I've been with her for more than half my life. I feel dead. There isn't a moment when I am not thinking of her and what she's doing.

How do I go on? There is nothing left that is me. At what point do I just admit defeat?",zzubnik,5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/abcb7r/how_am_i_supposed_to_cope_watching_my_wifes/,12/31/2018/23:02:51,abcb7r,SuicideWatch

It's so hard having to hide my true emotions and mental to my family,"I always hide how i really feel to my family cause i don't want them to worry about me.

I'm now currently having dinner with my family in the new years eve, I'm broken inside and i only want to cry but I'm there pretending to be happy and talking with them like that wojak who's crying but hiding it with a smiling face mask. I have to make short breaks every 15 minutes because i feel like i can't hold my tears and the pain is killing me. I constantly think about killing myself but i know I'm a fucking pussy and probably will never do it and keep suffering silently.

Christmas should be for enjoying it and being happy and yet here i am like a sad boy wanting to die. Feeling lonely is so painful, I'm a fucking 20 years old loser and a loner, don't have friends, gf or any of that stuff, and then there's my little cousin (13 years old) going out with his friends almost everyday, goes to parties every weekend and probably hanging out with girls too.

I’m incredibly lonely and probably always will be. It’s agonizing to live this way.,"Long story short, I’m too scared to reach out and have meaningful relationships. I have a mental illness of some damn sort that I don’t know how to identify quite correctly that makes me so afraid of genuine human interaction and letting people in. My codependency and trauma have me trapped in an abusive relationship I don’t know how to get out of. Ive lost my friends because of this and I can’t pretend to feign a relationship with my family anymore. I fake who I am and what I feel every day. I can’t show anyone the real me, or even a fake me most days without enormous effort, not even to internet strangers. I’d love to even have internet friends but it’s terrifying to even post here. It’s been like this my whole life and I don’t know how to stop. I’ve been in therapy so often and tried different pills. I can feel that nobody gives a shit about me, not really anyway, and it’s all my fault because I don’t let them. I don’t know when it will end. I don’t know what it takes to stop it. I know it’s all my fault in the end, but I just don’t have the willpower to try anymore.

A person can’t live like this. Human beings need other people, it’s just how we’re wired. And I can’t live like this as a functioning adult with a job. I think I’ve been doomed from the start.

"I need help, somehow","As dramatic as this title sounds, dear redditors, I guess this time I won't be lucky.
I used to live in a dorm room with rats and cockroaches. My girlfriend got me out of there by finding a loophole in my contract. We moved together and because Stuttgart is incredibly expensive, we had to move together with her ex. Her ex intentionally fucked up to pay the rent so often, that our landlord ended our contract in an unpreventable way. My girlfriend and I wanted to look for a new flat in peace but her exes kamikaze-act killed this option. Since I am an orphant and her family lives far across the country, we cannot simply move to her family for a while.
Problem 2: All payable flats would be too far away from both of our workplaces and for her cat to be moved, since she has a failing heart.
And, because that is just not enough, my work contract is going to end on February 14th. I've started applying two months ago but nobody seems to want to hire a college student.
Problem 4: Without any income of me, neither of us even close to be able to pay any of the offered flats.
But wait, there's more: Losing our home in 15 days, losing my job in 1.5 months and constant failure in college have triggered my suicidal thoughts to come back. I barely can say a word without bursting in tears and still I manage to fake trust and believe to calm her.
I'm 21, she's 27. Neither of us has ever been in a situation as such. I just, I just really don't know what to do anymore. I've even fucking pucked while writing this text in fear. Please, suggest anything. I don't believe in god but I'd even be happy about thoughts and prayers.

There’s just no point in continuing this meaningless existence.  Life is just a series of periods of times spent existing in one location and then spent existing in another.  Forever until you die.  There’s just no point to it.

None of my time existing is happy, it’s all sad and all I want to do is cry and yell and stop being conscious.

There’s truly no future to work toward or hope for.  I’m a 33 year old tranny that no one will ever love or have any kind of attraction towards and I can’t have real sex anyway even if someone did (which they never would anyway because no one wants to fuck Shrek in a dress).

Will to live is gone.,"Hey y'all. 
I feel absolutley apathetic.
I don't have emotions anymore... just anger/irritability. I have struggled with depression my whole life. But this past month it has hit an all time low. I had dreams. Big ones. Used to be someone who could accomplish a lot. Do big things. [I had a huge following on ifunny and got featured many times. I put so much of myself into it and got 3k overnight once] Even though it was ultimately a distraction from my everyday life and depression as well. 
I just dont care anymore. Little tasks are hard. I can't get myself to shower or brush my teeth. What's the point? 
I lost 76 pounds and have gained most of it back. Because I stress eat and dont get out of bed. 
I recently started cutting myself again. Getting urges to buy a pocket knife just for it.
Slowly getting urges to take pills. Lots of them. 
I have a shed of a dream and a shed of a person left. 
How the fuck am I supposed to become normal? Functioning? And ambitious? ( a dream in itself)

When all I think about is fucking killing myself and hoping my family suffers by knowing I'm gone?

Update on college/major/gun,"So, I did manage to get a car. That's one not terrible thing. However, there is no way I can afford tuition for next year. Without my knowing, my father roped my aunt and uncle into a loan - he has a mortgage and my credit went down after he cancelled a loan I cosigned on, not to mention being in college full time with minimal income - and they are pissed at me for quitting the job I had last summer. (They refused to pay me. My trainer stole my money. I was talking to lawyers about it and they stopped responding. I don't know what to do about that now.)

Several family members owe me money. I have 3k in a savings account. That'll all be eaten up by rent. I'm trying to get more hours in at work, but that hasn't worked well for me, historically. I can't live with my stepfather because he found a girlfriend who reminds me too much of my abusive mother. My father refuses to clean the house at all and I keep begging him to at least clear some of his Very Important Papers off of the table so I can use the kitchen. I can't trust my roommate with anything personal anymore. I'm trying to apply for a study abroad to at least try to use my backup major, but my father thinks it's a complete waste of time. ""What will that do for you?!"" I have no idea how I'm going to be able to afford it. My bills keep going up and I'm not making enough to cover the difference. I have a court date for a ticket due to an accident that was a result of insurance fraud. This car ate all of my leftover savings. I have six hundred dollars for food, supplies (textbooks/clothes/toilet paper/etc.), and utilities (gas/tires/wifi/electricity/tuition/etc.)

I guess what I'm saying is, I waited for things to get better for years. I feel like I have nowhere left to go. I'm waiting until the 31st of January. If nothing has improved by then, I'm signing off.

I'm not posting here for attention. I know everyone here has their own lives and their own struggles. I just need a place to vent to people who won't start trying to yell at, guilt, or call the police on me. I don't have anyone else to turn to, so for now, I'm just writing to you, Reddit.

Problem,"Hi,

So as I am spending New Year alone like every year it somehow starts to touch me emotionally.

I got used to the loneliness however past few days I began to notice I want to interact at least in some community.

&#x200B;

However I realize that I always get to the point that I do not know how, everytime I try to join conversation or chat I just do not get it, I feel like everything is so generic and boring that I feel I only see bots talking and when the conversation is worthwhile I am immediately in opposition against all or bitter as hell or VERY VERY provocative.

Where can I study some human behavior so I can understand it better? I do not understand but I believe I can not handle another year like this.

Trapped in my own body,"I’m pregnant, my due date was actually yesterday, and all I want to do is kill myself. I wanted to kill myself before I got pregnant and I’ve had two attempts. One before the pregnancy and one during the start of my pregnancy. Both baby and me survived and as he started to move around and kick I’ve felt trapped. All I want to do is die and my son is stopping me because while he’s inside me his life depends on mine. My life has completely turned upside down, I got kicked out of my house defending my child’s father only for him to turn around and leave me when I needed him most, I’ve been back and forth in the hospital and in behavioral therapy. Last month I ran away on foot in the middle of the night because I was afraid that if I stayed in the house I’d kill myself and my mom would have to be the one to find me. I’ve been trying to refrain from medication because my mom tells me how bad it is for the baby but I’m started to feel hopeless. My thoughts never stop not even when I’m asleep. I feel like I can’t react to anything. I can’t get too upset because that’s “bad for baby” I can’t kill my self because I’m still pregnant, I can’t talk to my mom because she uses me to gossip to her friends and the rest of my family. She took my car away because I tried to kill myself via car crash so I can’t go to counseling because she always starts taking me and then stops. My dad makes fun of me because he doesn’t believe in mental health issues. I made the mistake of getting together with my best friend three years ago and then having a baby and now we’re broken up and I’m friendless. I have social anxiety and even when I try my hardest I can’t make a friend. Everything in my life is so awful and all I want to do is die and now I can’t. Because I’m pregnant and when I do have the baby I have to parent him. I’m trapped here.

X-post r/PetLoss I blame myself for the deaths of 4 cats over 4 years and can’t take it anymore,"Tl;dr at bottom but if any of you could please take the time to read this all, I would appreciate it. I’m teetering on the edge right now and don’t know if I deserve to see this new year.

- Someone reported local strays to the city’s animal control. My guardian fed them against my wishes. I feel a lot of guilt over turning in the more docile of the strays - Shak - in what I admit was a rash decision to try and get animal control off our backs. (I would later go to the shelter to try and adopt him officially but the shelter repeatedly told me he was too sick and I felt pressured to let them put him down, which they did. Shak’s fate contributes significantly to my guilt.)

Animal control demanded to ask if I had any other pets. For reasons I’d rather not disclose, even a small interaction with law enforcement is very dangerous for my family. Afraid of this, I let the officer see our three cats: Merlin (12), Shiro (13) and Puss (12). This event would contribute to the deaths of the other three. 

- Puss was a stray cat we took in when I was just starting high school. He seemed to be around 4-5 at the time. He clearly had herpes, and had a constant upper respiratory infection.

The only vet we could afford to take him to at the time was a local humane society. We’d take him for antibiotics, his upper respiratory would clear up for a few weeks and then it would come back. First we’d take him every time it came back but eventually I 

1. Was too lazy to get up at 7am to wait in line at the humane society 
2. Didn’t want to spend all my money on something that only temporarily seemed to help him
3. Knew that because he had herpes and feline asthma, the treatment was really only useful when the URI developed a secondary infection.

I was a teenager, lazy and irresponsible. I selfishly aggravated his asthma by not taking him every single month for the antibiotics. About 6 years passed in this manner.

Puss would fluctuate between being well and looking ill. About two years before he passed away, when he was around 11 - I suddenly noticed that he had lost a lot of weight. I don’t know why it didn’t occur to me sooner. I guess it was so gradual until one day it hit me.

We took him to the vet and after a lot of thought we agreed to try and fight. We got him on two antibiotics, they gave him fluids and heavy calorie food. For two days he wouldn’t eat until it occurred to a family member to buy some treats he’d been given for years before we stopped buying “unhealthy” food. He ate! Then he ate a pepperoni. Gradually we fattened him up with a combination of kitten food and higher fat cat food. It was wonderful to see him gain nearly 4lbs over the course of a year.

During this time it was clear he needed dental work, but it was a risk. Due to the constant URI an asthma, he had developed scarring in his lungs. Eventually he developed a wheeze which we followed up on with various specialists. Eventually a CT scan revealed his nasal passages had essentially collapsed from the constant blockages. That is to say, I should have gotten every upper respiratory treated because the prolonged damage hurt him. He also needed extensive dental work and had an ear infection. After much deliberation we spent about 8k total on surgery to fix all these issues, knowing the risks. Puss failed to thrive post surgery. I resorted to giving him two month old subcutaneous fluids that had been used once (with a sterile line and needle obviously) when his vet couldn’t squeeze him in and I was desperate to hydrate him. He was already feverish. Despite being on antibiotics at the time, this was clearly a horrible call on my part. I should have hospitalized him then but to be honest we didn’t want to spend any more money for reasons involving the other cats. The vet had already kept puss overnight pro-bono, and the dentist had done the work for free as well and we could not push for any more charity.  A week later he woke up clearly dizzy. I called his vet desperate and they suggested a human OTC med in a small dose.I rushed out and got it, gave it to him. Later that day he went into respiratory arrest. He passed away in my sisters arms. We had called a home euthanasia service but they didn’t make it in time. His last moments were spent struggling to breathe. This death, aside from that of Shak, was so much my fault that I won’t blame any of you for calling me a monster. I feel like one. I should have taken him to be hospitalized again but I didn’t do so. 

- Merlin was un-neutered and not up to date on his rabies. It didn’t seem like a big deal because all my boys were indoor only, but animal control demanded I fix it or they would take all three away.  I rushed Merlin in to get his rabies shot. Shiro was actually getting surgery that same day (more below.) At the time the vet offered some free sub-q fluids in house because he was dehydrated and I agreed. I now wonder if those were contaminated. A month later Merlin was also neutered and got some dental work. However, a few weeks later it was clear something was off. One of his eyes developed a cornea issue and became bloody despite treatment with a specialist. He’d lay down in weird positions, his drinking was going down, his BMs became irregular. We did a ton of testing for several weeks -  lots and lots of bloodwork and al ultrasound. During this time I feared it was dry FIP. I couldn’t tell you why but I was petrified that it was. Of course, FIP is almost always in kittens so my vet brushed it off. The test for FIP was negative. In any case, several tests and medicines later we realized Merlin wasn’t going to get better. We took him home with antibiotics, pain meds and sub-q fluids. One day Merlin went into my bathroom and curled up on the toilet seat. By this point he hadn’t eliminated in two weeks and had stopped eating/drinking. He was trembling. We called the home euthanasia service for the next morning. The next morning he woke and ate for the first time in days. He eliminated three times. But his breathing seemed so labored and he just seemed so cold. We put him down but I have always wondered if the fluids were contaminated or if the stress I put him through triggered the FIP. I couldn’t live without knowing so we did order a necropsy and FIP was confirmed. All his little organs were ravaged. He’d been in pain before the pain meds. More than once I lost my temper at him when he wouldn’t take his medicine or sit still for sub-qs. Merlin was my baby and I failed him. All this was happening immediately before Puss. Merlin passed away October 17th and Puss February 2nd.

- During this time, Shiro was also ill. We adopted him as a stray as well. He had stomatitis for which we had his molars removed. He developed diabetes around age 8. When we worked on treating this, he was diagnosed with a heart murmur and a form of cardiomyopathy. The vets we had at that time were very very greedy. We switched to another vet and got the diabetes under control with diet. He saw a cardiologist every 9 months to keep an eye on his heart. He also had the rest of his teeth removed (it never stopped him from eating) when the stomatitis made his mouth painful. He did great post tooth removal. However, around the same time that Merlin was ill we noticed him drinking a lot of water. 8 days after Merlin passed away - Shiro was diagnosing with chronic kidney disease. We managed it successfully for two years, balancing the dietary needs of both diabetes and kidney disease. We did small amounts of sub-qs, knowing it was a slight risk to his heart. About two months after his last cardiology appointment I thought I saw the same glimmer in his eye that kickstarted Merlin’s FIP diagnosis. Freaked out, I took him to three vets in one week. The eye issue turned out to be aging related. All the vets at the time said he was in good health. The last vet he saw was on a Thursday. Sunday morning he woke up from a nap struggling to breathe. We took him to the ER and they informed us his heart had finally entered congestive heart failure. He was given a diuretic, some pain meds, oxygen and we took him home. He had a wonderful last evening before the home euthanasia came. When they came he hid under the table. Eventually I pulled him out, as the home euthanasia lady had waited politely for a half hour. When she sedated him, I wasn’t prepared for how quickly he became sedated. I feel like I missed his last truly conscious moments. My sister immediately went to him and comforted him but I was distracted signing paperwork. I regret this so much. I pulled him out from the table, I didn’t go to him immediately, I believe that my stressing him out caused the failure of his heart. 

I am constantly contemplating suicide. These were my babies. For years the only reason I didn’t kill my self was because I knew they needed me. Ultimately, their deaths were all my fault and I hate myself. I’ve been in therapy for almost 15 years. I’m medicated. My family is abusive and did not help financially with the pets although they were not cruel when they passed away. I can live with a lot of my life issues but I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s been four years since Merlin and Puss passed away, two since Shiro. I can’t let go. No amount of therapy has helped. I can never make up for what I did or didn’t do. I miss my boys.

The political climate has robbed me of my future. Mental illness has robbed me of the ability to connect normally. Family abuse has stunted my emotional and social development. I have no one but my sister, who is independently wealthy and had detached from my suicidal feelings.  I have no friends. I only lived for those cats. 15 years of therapy and meds, two attempts later and I still can’t shake the urge to end it. 

Tl;dr: I handed over a docile stray to be euthanized because of a fear of law enforcement. I neglected long term treatment of one cat and the surgery to treat the results resulted in a failure to thrive post surgery which I likely aggravated with old sub-q fluids. I worry that rushed and stressful treatment of two cats brought on illness resulting in death, separate incidents. I can’t stand the guilt. I am a monster. Therapy and meds haven’t helped. I don’t want to see the new year.

Back again,"Hello again.

I think I'm almost done here. It's reaching the anniversary of when I left for the navy and failed. Everything seems to be getting worse. I broke down in front of my mom and left the house for a little bit. 

I feel so weak rn. I shouldnt have broke down like that and now all I can think about is how my parents think of me now. 

I can't keep going on like this. I've failed and I feel so broken. I can't even find a permanent position at my work. 

There's a gas station near where I live. I can just walk over there. Figured I'd take my knife with me, hide out in the bathroom, type out my last goodbye on facebook, and just get it done and over with. 

I'm scared though. I don't want to have to deal with the stress anymore but I'm afraid of what will happen to my family, at least those that care, when I'm gone. I know theyll get over it eventually but I feel so guilty with just making up the plan.

[HTH got F****D],"Please don't read the following and waste your time. I'm gonna be deleting my account pretty soon enough i think. At least it'd lighten the load on reddits servers :p


So What is my problem in life you ask??? Lets see


1) Crashed car? Check
2) Got mugged? Check
3) Reject your offer of help on reddit! Check
4) Christmas gifts got you hate? Check
5) Help colleagues & Get hated on? Check

Why the fuck can't I have a meaningful relation in life?

I don't know! I look decent, I can hold conversations and yet I'm alone! Both in real life and on reddit? I'm not looking for relationships, I'm just looking for someone with whom I can feel a bit more engaged.

So I have been a decorated orator, and actor, so clearly my physical looks/oratory aren't the problem. 
For arguments sake even if they were then at least on reddit I shouldn't have had a problem! But I don't know what's going on!!! 

I really waana help people out, in whatever way I can, and I've fucking tried. Almost no one responds! Its like  people can figure out my post! And for the ones with which I initiate contact after 2-3 messages almost everyone seems to waana take my leave (almost because for the second time I got blocked, which makes it an approx  88% ghosting rate. Shocking !!! Right?

If I could post some advice on how to respond to a message from a person willing to help, don't ghost them! It takes an incredible amount of time and effort to prioritise you over whatever it is that goes on in their lives. The least you can do is to NOT leave the conversation unfinished.

So... Any advice on how to get better at this? Nope. Sorry, I would have written something if I knew, but I mean its really shocking how fucked I feel right now. Everything just wants to turn its back on me! I crashed my car, got mugged, got blocked on reddit, took the blame for coworkers in office, bought gifts for a couple for Christmas only to feel absolutely small and useless in life all in 4 days? 

Honestly I feel battered and bruised, both emotionally and mentally. Hopefully y'all have a better year than me. 

Happy New Year!

What’s the logical point of continuing to live? And I want to be selfish.,"All I hear is people going ‘oh it gets better’ and ‘oh there so many good things to live through in life’ and I’m like so? The more I think about it the more I realize there really is no point from a logical standpoint to live. Everyone’s fake, everything costs money, and we’re all gonna die anyway. People say all the time money doesn’t matter because we’re not gonna take it when we die. But what about just life period? I mean, fuck, when I die none of the shit that happened in my life will matter depending on what afterlife, if any, awaits us at all. So honestly, I really don’t see the point in living. Am I going to kill myself? No. I am too much of a pussy and I don’t want to hurt those that love me. And so I’m stuck in this vortex of being forced to live. As much as I love my dad and as much as he loves me, he’d probably say I’m being overdraumatic and probably yell at me for saying this on the internet. I’m 21.

Anyhow, people say it’s the most selfish thing to do. That our loved ones would suffer... and honestly, a part of me doesn’t care. It’s a selfish thing to do? Who fucking cares? Everyone’s selfish. The world did nothing for me. Why should I care?  It’s not my fault I’m this way. It’s the fucking people and world that made me this way. So if anything, that should be to blame. 

And people say to get help. What fucking help? I texted a suicide hotline last week and as nice as the lady was, at the end of the day I don’t know who the fuck she is. She doesn’t know me. If I kill myself she doesn’t even know. She’s only trained to speak to me because it’s her job, actual paid or volunteer. My therapist. As sweet as she is, I still have to pay fucking money to see her. Our relationship is an illusion of friendship and safety. Sure, she listens to our bullshit, but at the end of the day I’m still her paycheck. Even if she does feel horrible if I ever kill myself, she’ll move on. It’s not like we’re friends. I can’t personally visit her outside of her work and say go watch a movie. I feel like everything in this fucking world is so fake.

And then they say call 911 if you’re in danger. Why? So I can pay a shit ton of money for just calling the fucking number? What if I have no fucking money? Am I just supposed to say ‘whoops’ and just kill myself? And it supposedly my fault for not getting help? He help is a fucking facade anyway. 

Everything’s fucking fake. I see no point in anything. I don’t even see a point in having a happy life. Say I become famous and successful. What’s the point? I’m gonna die anyway. It’s all temporary. Why is everyone so controlled by their emotions? All it does is make us fucking blind to logic.",Aqua7KH,61,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ab8a1c/whats_the_logical_point_of_continuing_to_live_and/,12/31/2018/15:54:04,ab8a1c,SuicideWatch

Goodluck to everyone in 2019,"I'm just tired of all the insane bullshit from everyone, men to women to black to white to straight to gay and all in between. I've been working on myself through therapy for the past 14 years and it doesn't seem to be helping me. In fact, I feel like I'm getting worse. I've been trying every dating app under the sun (tinder, bumble, okcupid, PoF, coffe.meets.bagel, bbw meet, black people meet, match.com, bi singles, etc.) And yet here I am still single through all of it with not even a simple kiss to show for it. I constantly work out and exercise and still no attention. 

People are severely unkind and I'm so ugly apparently that even when I have a mental breakdown, no one seems to notice or maybe they just don't care. People on here keep saying to cut out all toxic people from your life to be mentally sound. 

Of course that sounds logical and great but then I found myself all alone. Everyone seemed to be incredibly toxic: family members with their lack of knowledge on mental health issues, friends and co workers with their degrading comments and gossiping towards people who aren't like them (like seriously one guy complained because this woman eas taking off from work weeks at a time....for chemotherapy. Who bitches about that). It's all so toxic I constantly feel like I am still in high school despite being around people close or in their 30s. 

I'm just tired of it all and this will be my last time on here. I just wanted to say, to this sub in particular, thank you. I hope all you women have good, blessed, and happy lives in the new year. 

My 30th is in a week so if you want you can also wish me a happy 30th b-day. I honestly won't last that much longer.

I'm alone and I don't care.,"It's New Year's Eve and I'm spending it alone with a bottle of wine and my two cats. My boyfriend is supposed to be here, but isn't. I don't mind. I think I'm emotionally detached, so much so that the things that used to make me feel lonely don't have any effect anymore. I guess all the stress of problems and a boyfriend that seems to be busy with work a lot emptied me out. The old me would be so upset right now. But now? I don't feel anything.
Which is scary I guess, if coupled with severe depression and suicidal thoughts. The only reason I'm not going through with it yet is because I don't know what to do with my sweet cats and I want to fast first so I don't poop and vomit when I expire lol.

Got some good news today :),"I've gained access to life ending drugs that will ensure me a peaceful and comfortable death if I ever need them. I've developed something called ENS (Empty Nose Syndrome) from a surgery I had in late May 2018. The symptoms started 3 months ago and have only gotten worse. There's no cure or effective treatment, none of them are covered by insurance and they might even make you worse.

I'm only 19 and I already came from a background of having extreme ancient, paranoia, panic attacks, child abuse, fucked up family, poor health, bullying and severe phobias. But even after all of those I was still happy, I always saw the light on the other side and had a positive outlook. I even finally got a job that I loved but ever since ENS my life has been a constant hell. My only remaining family that isn't gone, dead or literally mentally retarded is my mother who has also been extremely unsupportive and outright aggressive towards me and I know the reason why. My brother got autism from what she believes was vaccines when he was 3 she had me because I was supposed to be the healthy one but I've been a disappointment all the way. Do I blame myself? FUCK NO, in fact I blame her. She's the one that chose to breed when she was 35 and with a fucking diseased riddled genetic pile of trash. I blame her for every pain I've felt in my life because she had the opportunity to breed with her young healthy stud when she was in her 20's but she waited too long and got unhealthy genetic trash children.

I've told her that if there is such a thing as hell that she will burn there for all eternity, just like she has told me that I will do so if I commit suicide. I honestly don't understand how assisted suicide is not a common thing in 2018, if someone doesn't want to live anymore they should be given the means to do so. I mean I get how therapy like this subreddit could help people with mental problems or teenage bullshit about relationships, but I have a medical condition that I was not warned could be the outcome of a surgery. Every breath I take is uncomfortable, in a literal sense. Not like in my life being bad, I have actual nerve damage that makes it uncomfortable and occasionally I get extreme suffocation.

I didn't think something like ENS was possible in 2018 but we still live in the fucking medical dark ages. There's no cure for ENS and there's no hope in sight for at least the next 20 years if even that, even the main experts of ENS has said so. I mean fuck now that I have access to these life ending drugs at least I might be able to keep myself alive in agony for a few years just to see what happens in the world, but it has given me such a great comfort. I finally have the power over my life that I needed, now I can quit whenever I want. I mean I would like for there to be assisted suicide clinics where people with both psychological and physical condition could go to get a GUARANTEED DEATH, but that just doesn't exist yet. Although New Mexico might legalize it in 2019, even via telemedicine which would allow it in all 50 states.

Humans should not be forced to jump in front of fucking trains or risk botching their deaths just because they want to exit this world. Those that want to leave should have that option of just paying a clinic almost like a motel room and being able to slip into a comfortable eternal sleep forever if they so choose. But people don't want their perfect little worlds to be shattered by the amount of people that would use the service. They would rather pretend that everything is just sunshine and rainbows and that all ailments can be cured.

I don't really want to live anymore because I see no reason in it. I'm not getting shit done. I'm just useless. I'm still going to school and that's kinda nice because I have something in my life which just is there and I don't really have to care about it but it's my last year in school... I don't have any idea what I could do afterwards. By this time I'm supposed to already have applied for some universities or jobs or something but I have nothing... I don't want to stay at home for one year and do nothing. I don't want to stay at my parents house. I don't really like them even though I don't really have a reason for that. But I just can't talk to them. When they ask me something I just ignore them. When I have to walk by them my heart is beating faster. I think I have social anxiety and the same thing that happens when I'm around strangers happens with my parents.

Also I feel like I'm just complaining all the time about how bad my life is even though I don't really have a reason to do it. A friend told me I should do something about it but I just can't. Idk why. I can't stop thinking I'm ugly, I'm useless, I'm awful, and all that stuff. I can't start doing something. I mean like having a hobby or doing sports.

Ive been with an Asian girl for 3 and a half years. However, she has a dark past. She used to work as a masseuse, which really means she gave handjobs (and probably more for a living). She stopped that work 3 years ago in order to continue our relationship. She now works in a restaurant as a waitress/floor manager.

She is expecting my kid in a couple of months. But i cant live with the shame of my situation. Most normal guys have normal girlfriends who have university degrees.

My girlfriend has visited my home a couple of times and my parents love her. But her past is still there, gnawing away at me and making me feel ashamed of myself. Ashamed I stooped so low in life that I ended up with a former hooker.

I try and be objective, and think about the need to make a living in a developing nation from her perspective. But I still cant get over my own shame. I sacrificed working a normal office job in order to build a career online, just to facilitate this pathetic relationship.
Someone please talk sense into me. I have 4mg worth of xanax and some whiskey here to do the job.

3. Get 60 50mg of dph.
4. Wait for so to leave to uni.
5. Get into shower and bleed out while on sleeping pills.

I’ve visited my family in the US, i’ve visited my so family in eastern europe. I feel like these are my goodbyes to the fams. 

I’m tired and in pain, and the impending void calls out my name every day at every time.

Will be posting my plan with more detail later, for tonight I’ll just take more dph and hopefully pass out🌺. The void is calling my name and i need to follow it. Hallucinations, dissociation, anxiety, depression, bpd, ptsd, ocd ... how many more labels do they want to throw at me before helping?

I want to be here,"Humans don't live long enough too be perfectly honest

The sun on your face 

Cool breeze brushing past the fields of grass

Even sitting in a dark room with your dark thoughts

The good and bad

It's all so beautiful in its own way.  ",,21,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ab70jd/i_want_to_be_here/,12/31/2018/13:14:13,ab70jd,SuicideWatch
I am so worthless,"Don't know why I'm posting here but here goes. I am completely useless, I think about killing myself every day and nothing I ever tried makes me feel better for long 😢

No matter what I do I always end up back in this shit state, my mental health has always been so bad and my mind is a prison. The few people I speak to about any negative shit give me good advice but I can't act on it in any way. I think I'm just wired wrongly to survive in this world 😔

I can't work in any kind of job, I am constantly getting sick notes and they all hated me for it, and on top of that I'm completely scared of people in general and it only gets worse as I get older.

I'm completely sober writing this nowadays and have been for years so it's not just the alcohol or drugs 😔

I wasted the last year trying to be a musician but I know nobody and am too scared to ever actually network plus I have no talent so that was a deluded waste of time 😔

I went back on the dole again and have to work 25 hours in a charity shop for 20 pounds a week allowance which isn't even enough for food. I wouldn't mind doing that but last time I went to jobs the bosses hated me for being so lethargic and useless and it made me feel even worse. For the past years I've not done anything productive. I'm basically the biggest loser alive and am an embarassment of a person 😢

I'm almost 26 and I'll be homeless before long I bet, which is what I deserve for being this useless 😢

My family hates me but I'm totally dependent on them which makes me hated even more 😢

I always feel really isolated and down nowadays and nobody understands exactly how bad I feel it's like they just go through the motions with good advice which may or may not works for themselves 😢

I have nothing and wish I was never alive. The world is just a horrible and hostile place at least for me 😔 

So I'll kill myself soon or fail again like the last few times 😢",HollieSk8rGrrl,1,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ab6ykd/i_am_so_worthless/,12/31/2018/13:06:42,ab6ykd,SuicideWatch

Hopelessness,"Given the fact, most don’t succeed in moving up in social class but in fact stagnant, being born into poverty is a huge indicator of life as it stands to be, disfunction and discontentment, now that we understand poverty is usually a life sentence, for “normal people”. We can then look at my other inhibiting factors, I am quite ugly 4/10 to 5/10 at best, I am also below average 5’6”, 2 standard deviations below average height for a male. Height influences how you are seen, so this it has been shown to have correlation to election outcomes, promotions, attractiveness and how successful you look, so being a male cursed with female height is not exactly the best when coupled with the other two, furthermore, I occupy some shitty podunk county in New York State, so there is no opportunity. The cru de grau, of this hopeless spiral, I have ASD, given this information, I can’t make friends, despite my numerous attempts. For this reason I am largely isolated and alone, most people with ASD will be unemployed or underemployed. We can combine all these factors to understand, life for me as it stands is overly pointless, I would be living to run the fucking hamster wheel so that machine works, thrown to the wolves while expect to still provide what is remaining to some fucked up pyramid. I don’t There is a reason for me not buy a revolver in two years time and blow my fucking brains on the wall, I will never be sad and I won’t have suffer this way ever again, no more inferior genetics, fucked up body development and poverty, the move to neutral which is death, is better than the suffering that is my existence.

So afraid of being alone,"I feel like I really will soon. I have a whole plan laid out in my head for how I will do it already and I just feel so pathetic for falling so low. 

I'm so terribly lonely and I really shouldn't be, I have family and some friends but I just know I'm a hassle for them. This constant emotional drain that's constantly tacking them down and I don't want to be that. I still haven't been able to get into see a therapist or psychologist and at this point I don't think I ever will. 

My only solace is an otome game that makes me feel even more pathetic because the only way I can ever feel loved is through a game. Solidifying that no one actually will. I'd hate to feel actually alone and I trick myself I'm not by playing the game. And I'm sure this isn't healthy either but I really have nothing else for me. 

I know I look like I'm just some meek girl barely even a woman at this point ready to kill herself because no one loves her. And I both hate that feeling but I know it's right too.

A tiring compulsive need to be creative,"Sometimes I get really motivated and try to create some really popular project that will make me famous / rich, and I hate this feeling. I'm already exhausted after coming home from school / work, yet I feel this need to be productive all the time.

Like the only break I'll get is when I'm dead, but even then I'm afraid of not leaving behind a legacy and being forgotten.

In short, I envy all the other people who can live life without clinging unto one idea so viciously. Those who can look at Hell (Scrupulosity) or Blindness (Contamination) without fear. And even then I believe that everyone goes to Heaven when they die, no matter what religion or lack thereof that they believe in, because I just want everyone to be infinitely happy forever, I just want all this suffering to be worth it somehow.

"After an accident, I feel like a burden to everyone","So this post may be a long one, so bear with me. As a little backstory, I am 22 and engaged to the woman of my dreams. I am the oldest of 3 children. I have had bouts of depression throughout my life.

So in October of this year, my fiancee and I visited her family down south. While at her father's house (her parents are divorced) he offered to let me drive his ATV down a rural road adjacent to his house. Being born and raised in the Midwest, I was no stranger to ATVs and had driven them often at my uncles farm. I took off down the road, hit about 35 MPH and the front right wheel of the ATV slipped off the side of the road and last thing I remember thinking was hoping my fiancee could forgive me, as honestly I thought I was dead. My life flashed before my eyes and everything.

I woke up with blood all over my clothes. The ATV had flipped over, and thankfully not onto me. I yelled for help and felt my forehead, which was the source of the blood. I think I passed out a couple more times and came to with fiancee's father's truck pulling up next to me, my fiancee and him pulling me up and into his truck. The rest is a daze, I remember looking in the mirror at my forehead and throwing up from disgust at my injuries. I do remember getting sewn up at the hospital and getting put in a CT machine. I was diagnosed with a concussion as well.

A few days later we came back home and I have been on medical leave at my work since then. My job is pretty physical and won't allow me to come back until I can fulfill my duties without many alterations. I have daily migraines and blurred vision intermittently. I also have crushing anxiety and flashbacks to the wreck regularly. I also have nightmares regularly, usually about the wreck. As such my fiancee has been having an unnecessarily stressful life, being the main breadwinner. I feel so guilty that she has to do this.

Come Christmas time, I visit my family for dinner and what not. While there, I talked to my sister in depth about my parent's marital problems. She is still in high school so still lives with my mom and dad. Long story short on that, my dad had a Facebook for a while until my mom found out he was emotionally cheating on him with a woman from another country. Things have been strained for a year or so. Holidays with my family have been kinda tense since then.

&#x200B;

Anyways, my sister divulged a bit of information I had never heard before. Supposedly, my parents were unhappy and already seperated when they found out my mother was pregnant with me. I was the reason my mom and dad had stayed together, and also the reason my brother and sister were born. I feel guilty as I feel I am the root cause of my family's unhappiness. My siblings also have dealt with depression most of their life, and I feel like their existance is my fault. Upon leaving the dinner, my aunt remarks to me that I need to man up and get back to work, and that my fiancee shouldn't have to carry the burden of me on her shoulders. My family, except my brother, have never really been supportive much. 

&#x200B;

My fiancee did not quite know the extent of what I have been through until last night. We were cuddling watching ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" and the vignette with the quadruple amputee came on. I won't spoil it much, but I felt a lot like him. Not disabled, physically, I am very fortunate of that. But I just felt helpless to the depression and stress and concussion and trauma. I felt helpless to what life has been doing to me lately. I have felt I am on a roller coaster, helpless and strapped in. I started crying and my fiancee asked why. I told her that I have been feeling like a burden, I told her what my aunt said, and that I feel like my family's unhappiness is all my fault. She held me and reaffirmed that I wasn't a burden to her and that she loves me and that she'll help me find some resources to deal with my trauma.

&#x200B;

Honestly, though, I don't know if I can go on much longer. I honestly find myself hoping that I don't wake up in the morning, so everyone I depend on is no longer burdened by my existence.

What exactly happens when you call a hotline?,"I really don’t want to call one and get stuck on hold listening to crappy music that will make me want to kill myself more.

I don’t want to hack through a complicated phone tree that requires me to enter my information six times before getting someone to answer. 

I don’t want to get a sales pitch for a self help book for suicidal people. 

What happens when you call? 

What training does the person have? Is it some ten dollar an hour wage slave sitting in a cubicle, or someone who gives a shit? 

Am I likely to get a religious zealot on the other end who’ll tell me to love Jesus?

How long do I have until they hang up to take another caller? 

Will they trace my call and send police/ paramedics?

I hate everything,"So, this year had been pretty meh... I [m14] started liking this girl [f 16] who liked me back, but her parents didn’t like the age gap and told her that we couldn’t date, so that sucked... then whenever her and I had moved on, and school started, I met this incredible girl [f 15] and I almost fell in love instantly... we dated for about two months before she dumped me... it’s not the fact that she dumped me that makes me sad and mad and just... ugh, but rather how and why... she randomly texted me, “hey... so whenever you asked me out, you said that no matter what happened to us you wouldn’t let it ruin our friendship... does that still stand”... I immediately could tell what was happening, I started to have a panic attack and... well I cut myself... whenever I responded she proceeded to text me about how she’s come to the realization that she doesn’t love me in a romantic way, and that she never did... I really loved her... I looked to having a future with her and every time I mentioned it seeing that smile on her face... there wasn’t a doubt in my mind that she loved me back... when she ended things I didn’t want life to go on... I wanted it all to just stop... she broke up with me 16 days ago...

"Anyone else kinda feel like you're not gonna kill yourself rn, but so little would be needed to push you over the edge?","It's like, I hate being alive but as of right now, I doubt I'll kill myself. However if something happened I probably would. If that makes sense? 

For example, I am a talentless piece of shit/waste of resources but I am okay at the bass. At this point it is literally the only thing that makes me feel a modicum of self worth. I bought a very nice expensive bass somewhat recently and it ever broke or got stolen I'd probably off myself. Both due to the cost (I dont have a lot of money) and what I'd be without it.

Which in turn makes me feel even worse about myself that I'm pathetic enough that the only thing keeping me from committing suicide is a damn guitar? Like jesus that's rough

I'm currently applying to college and I dont need to get into my top school or anything but I honestly depending on where i got accepted that might be enough.

I know for sure if something happened to my family I'd be dead, due to the fact I wouldn't need to feel guilty about it anymore

It's just kinda weird that my will to live is that fragile

Friend from another country plans to commit suicide,"First of all I'm located in Germany, she's living in Russia. I figured somethings wrong with her and asked if she was suicidal. She said yes and after further questions told me that she wants to take her life on the 15. Of January by overdosing on pills.

Obviously I can just visit her and talk to her in person. Messaging is all I can do. But I do know where she lives.

Her reasoning was that she's tired of life and wants to end it on her birthday. 

And I'm pretty sure it's not just a cry for attention. She probably wouldn't have told me if I hadn't just asked her if she was thinking about suicide. 

Again, she's in Russia and I don't speak Russian. There's no one I could inform. And also she lives alone and has a bad relationship with her parents 


So what can I do? How should I talk to her?

My wife just wants me to leave if something goes wrong. She constantly wants to work on the marriage, like every second. I dread the weekends coz she’s home. Everything feels like an argument.

I’ve been suicidal all my adult life. I like to believe that I have a lot going for me and try to stay above. 

Maybe because I’m an introvert.

I'd rather be stupid,"You know when you figure something out that takes away the joy from your life? That everything you believed to be true was a lie? Or not even a lie, but an illusion? It could be discovering that your parents aren't your real parents, or maybe you grew up living a sheltered life, only to realize that the world around you is actually much harsher. It's like finally waking up and seeing the painful reality around you instead of the comforting lie that you lived before. 

For me, it was noticing that nobody really cares about you (somewhat liberating) and realizing that love doesn't exist. Think about it: all love, all kindness, is never to benefit the object of your affection, it is done to serve you, for your own selfish reasons. Even a mother's love for her child is entirely self centered: the mother doesn't really care about the child, but she needs her genes to be passed on, so evolution hardwired it in her to become attached to that child. Not for the child's sake, only so that the mother's genes can survive into the future. Any random act of kindness for a stranger done in the presence of others was probably a subconscious attempt by you to boost your own reputation. If any of you are lucky enough to have a significant other, your love for them is entirely conditional too. You only feel attached to them because you are passing on your genes through them. And even then, happiness is just chemicals in your brain.

I know this probably just sounds like rambling, but observable reality tells me that it holds true. Looking at it in such a robotic way is depressing, but it desensitizes me to the negative emotions that usually cloud my mind. Sometimes though, I'd rather be blissfully ignorant and stupid so that I could appreciate small things like that.",Spiritofthemountain,3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ab4wn5/id_rather_be_stupid/,12/31/2018/07:17:16,ab4wn5,SuicideWatch

Trying to keep struggling,"Hey everyone. I've recently stumbled upon this subreddit and I've been reading  a lot - obviously because I'm in similar situations like you guys. I'm a 21 german (sorry for my english) student who's struggled with loneliness and strong anxiety my entire life. Last year I met a Boy (yes I'm gay) and I fell in love with him. He on the other side only saw me as a friend which made me very sad but also made me realize quite a few things. I have a lot of issues regarding my anxiety which led to me being extremly lonely my entire life. I was bullied in high school as well and I tried to ignore all the pain through video games. Today I have an Addiction because I'm too scared of the world so I rather play video games and ignore the real world.

I've been thinking A LOT the past year because I'm alone most of my days which led to depression and extremely low self-esteem. There has always been this dark hole inside of me and it feels like something is missing from my life. A vital part and once I have it I'll be finally happy and at peace. I've been trying a lot. Spending time with friends, getting to know new people, education, work, it doesnt matter what I try it always seems to be useless because at the end of the day I feel like a worthless piece of shit who will never be happy and will struggle for the rest of my life. And I thought about suicide a lot as well. I thought about methods on how to do it. Why? Mostly because this endless cycle of suffering is so exhausting and I don't feel like I can handle it anymore. I dont really want to hurt anybody, I just want my suffering to end. I know there are good times in my life when I'm ""glad"" to be here but \~85% of every day I feel the exact opposite. Currently I'm going through a ""better phase"" I guess and I have a little bit more peace than usually but I know in at least a few days I'll be crying in my room again hoping to finally die.

But for now all I can say is please, keep staying alive. I know life is pain but I'm still here and maybe it's worth it? Even if all we do is chat here, hang in there, you are not alone and I know you guys are the bravest people one could ever meet.

When is it enough...,"This has been an abysmal end to what was otherwise a fairly decent year. Managed to leave the job that I hated that had been running me into the ground emotionally and mentally, was finally able to afford to purchase a (used) car for cheap, and had started working to reestablish a connection with my eight year old daughter.

&#x200B;

The same eight year old daughter, whom I learned on the 13th, had been being molested, along with her half-sister, by said sister's grandfather. I'm not going to go into specifics and details, but there's enough evidence that he's never going to see freedom outside of a prison again. She's seeing a therapist who's trained to deal with victims of abuse in this regard, and has a strong support group in the rest of the family to help her through this time. Regardless though, I feel like a failure of a father for not being able to protect her from this, even though there was literally nothing I could do, seeing as how the entire family was blindsided by this. I feel so proud of her for being brave enough to speak to someone, but can't help but think that I could have done something, anything to put a stop to it before it started.

&#x200B;

Following on the heels of that, my fiance, who I've been with for six years now, decided on the day after Christmas to break up with me. She told me that she wasn't sure if she even wants to be in a relationship with anyone right now, feels that we both have enough crap to deal with but should be trying to deal with it separately instead of together, that I need to work on improving myself, but not for her, and she thinks we both have had to compromise (or at least that I've had to compromise) more than is needed for a relationship. She's spending all her free time at her friend's house, along with said friend's boyfriend and their roommates (one of whom I feel she might be more involved with than just friends), smoking pot and being seemingly unaffected by the fact that a six year relationship just ended like that. Apparently, she had wanted to break up with me before Christmas, but ""didn't want to make things awkward since my family was coming to visit for Christmas"". And the same friend whose house she spends all her free time at, told me a whole eleven days before this happened, that she knew my fiance loved me very much and would do nothing to hurt me.

&#x200B;

I know that there's a lot I need to work on for myself, and I want to be someone who I don't hate when I look in the mirror. I know I need to be there for my daughter, who doesn't trust me very much, and with obvious reason. I know that I need to try and pick myself up so that I can finally move on. But I can't. I should have gone to bed two hours ago for work, but I'm not tired. I should be eating more, but I'm not hungry. I should be drinking more water, but I just don't care. I don't have any interest in doing anything, nor do I see a reason why I should even bother trying at this point. Because all that I'm good for, is ruining the things that are good in my life. I don't want to live when it's going to mean that all I ever do is hurt or screw things up. This was the longest relationship I had been in, the best thing to happen to me besides my daughter. Both relationships prior to this, ended with my significant other cheating on me. Because I'm not good enough to be with someone. If I was...then I wouldn't be dealing with this pain.

&#x200B;

The few people I've spoken to, have told me that I should go spend some time with family, seeing as how I don't have any friends near me that I can go and visit physically. All my friends live elsewhere, which means I'm stuck in this apartment by myself, dealing with these demons and the only support offered to me being through text rather than something as simple as someone just hugging me. I don't want to be told that everything will be okay, because I don't believe that's true. I know things aren't going to be okay. They never will be. If they were, I wouldn't be typing this out. I wouldn't be sitting up at midnight, trying not to break down into tears because of how worthless I am. I wish I never existed. I wish I wasn't too much of a coward to take my own life.

Will it get better? Because I thought I hit the bottom... Until now.,"24... No license, have never had one. Nobody ever has taught me how to drive and it's given me a phobia and trepidation towards learning to drive... No college education, save 2 or so years of community college... I had a good paying job at the beginning of 2018... well in late March I started it... 2 days after starting my grandmother passed away in my arms and I have PTSD from it. I eventually got fired from that job before any medical benefits could even kick in. I was kicked out of my... let's call it a hobbyist group... Eventually let back in but only when I moved in with someone else from the group... I eventually moved back home. Where I have a 50% ownership of this property but have to pay to eat food cooked on a stove I acquired, in a house that is 50% mine because I didn't buy the groceries for it. I'm lucky if I eat one meal a day. Got kicked out of the hobby group again. And I'm afraid of my nightmares coming to fruition of me being chased away from here with a handgun, which is the exact nightmare I just woke up from and the same nightmare that made me wonder is it worth it to tough it out anymore? I have nothing in my life to look forward to. Nothing to be happy about or for. No silver lining. And I am deathly afraid of calling any hotline or therapist because I've heard horror stories of people calling the hotline only to be charged thousands because they sent an ambulance to take them to a hospital for a mental checkup. I don't need a mental checkup. I need someone to tell me if it's worth it and why it's worth it to keep fighting because now I'm fighting just to fight and I feel miserable enough to quit.

i met myself under the water,"whenever i think of killing myself, the notion of doing it in a merciful way is always the one thing i try to avoid.
i guess i’ve always thought punishment is what i deserve. and sometimes i sit and ask myself what it is i’m punishing myself for, and i realize...
i realize that i need to punish myself for everything. who i am. what my existence does and has done to the people around me. 
so drowning always came to mind. 
i mean ... i fear the ocean, so isn’t that the perfect place?
isn’t it perfect to make sure that i suffer?

i don’t deserve to get to that age.
18 means freedom in so many ways, but i don’t deserve that.
i don’t deserve the chance.
all being who i am will do is cause more shame and resentment and disgust and anger...

it ruins all that i’ve ever taught myself to be proud of.

It DOESN'T get better. Not for everyone.,"I feel like I've been patient and making all the right choices and steps towards anything in my life improving. But... They're not. They never do. I try to do the right things and it inevitably takes me two steps back. Most things are out of my hands, anyways. The biggest problem is I literally can't afford to live right now, I'm disabled so I can't fix it by getting a job despite my family's constant insistence that I can, and I'm not disabled enough to be approved for SSI, apparently. 
There's just nowhere I belong. I don't enjoy life. I'm just in constant, chronic pain, and I can't even afford food. Why fight to stay here? I just feel completely clear-headed, and I feel like I'm timing straight.. But I can only come to the conclusion that I simply don't want to deal with this anymore. I don't believe in an afterlife.

“Tonight’s the night”,"-Dexter (great tv show you should all watch it)

I made a post about a week ago and deleted it I’m not sure if anybody remembers but it detailed that I was going to kill myself as the clock strikes midnight. 

It’s now seven and a half hours away from that and I’m still committed to it. I do have a lot of drugs and alcohol which I will soon fill myself up with. With the hopes it either brings me a positive experience or enough confidence to finally put an end to the constant misery which is my life.

After a Year of trying.,"I'm in the same place I was a year ago. I was going to jump to my death. I got there and sat there for a while, but I couldn't get myself to do it. I can't get myself to do anything. So instead I rested my head for a little while and fell asleep. The next thing I know I'm being pulled down, still feeling a little sleepy. The funny thing is, no one would have known where I was, if I hadn't prepared a timed post on Facebook intended to be my suicide note. Once the secret was out suddenly I get support. Suddenly I feel cared about. Then I decide to try. I go to see psychiatrists and therapists despite the burden that causes on the people who give me the support. For a time things go well. Unfortunately they stopped going well. Eventually that support dissipates, and my willingness to try with it. I tried being open, I tried taking meds. But it was never enough to get me to normal. And in the end I never really had the resources required to get me to a better place. And I know everyone gave up on me, but I can't call them out on it because then they will use that against me too. Exiled from society, all because I spoke out. I tried for a year and in the end I'm in the same place I started. Maybe I'm meant to die, and I just have to accept that. After a year of trying, I don't want to try anymore. I don't want to stay around for people who don't care about me when I'm not dying. I gave up a long time ago and I only stuck around because I thought they cared but in the end they don't care about me, they care about their false sense of duty. The false sense of duty to stop every suicide just because society thinks suicide is wrong. I'm going to die and I have already accepted that. I have nothing more to say.",lumo93,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ab46m2/after_a_year_of_trying/,12/31/2018/05:34:06,ab46m2,SuicideWatch

I want to die.,"I’m 14
I’m a male.
I live in LA

Every since I was 12 I’ve been having serious pain all over my body, to where I’m always in pain. Recently I’ve have been taking extreme amounts of painkillers every day, and I don’t know why I’m always in pain,  it’s mostly my back. I feel like I might have scoliosis.

I’m depressed, never happy. My grades are complete shit. My personality has changed negatively.

Instead of doing my homework after school I’ve been listening to music (Nirvana) and going to sleep in a endless fucking cycle.

I’m in my freshman year and I’ve already set myself up for failure.

I never fit in like how everyone else does, I’m a loner, with only a few real friends, (the rest being fake friends). 

I’m really ugly, at least that’s what I think and what most people think of me. 

I’m extremely lonely. I'd never have a girlfriend,

I”ll never be what anyone one else would want. I already know that my future is going to be terrible.

 I haven’t been happy since I was a care free kid.

All day everyday I’ve been thinking about killing myself, and what way I want to go out. I know I’m young, but might as well do it now, as I know everything will just get worse and worse, as years pass.

by now it’s finally dawned on me, that everything is pointless.

if i were to die today none of you would care, or notice...

i may turn to smoking weed or doing some crazy drugs like crack or heroin to suppress myself. 

all I can do is release it all on this post.",kiwisnipezz,3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ab3z1k/i_want_to_die/,12/31/2018/05:06:22,ab3z1k,SuicideWatch

Its not like I havent asked others for help either , like friends and family. It just gets brushed off or when I try to explain how I feel it feels inauthentic and makes me almost laugh. Anyone else?

hopefully i die soon (sorry for this post being all over the place),"I’m female and 14 in 10 days and a few hours, I know how bad that sounds but I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts since the age of 11. I’ve so far been diagnosed with severe anxiety and mild depression. 

I lost my father at age 11, in March, and nothing has been the same since. His passing isn’t the main thing that makes me want to die, I’m just constantly sad for no reason and I just feel like such a waste of space. I always cry and I’m such a pathetic child. I’m extremely self conscious and I’ll never think of myself as anything better than a waste of space. I come from a decently large family, and me being the youngest child doesn’t help as I’ve always been just kinda picked on I guess.

I self-harm, very often and it’s always in large amounts. All up both of my arms (from my wrists to my shoulders) are covered with cuts. I try to talk to my best friend about my cuts but he’s so accepting and he doesn’t see anything wrong with it. Personally I think of all my cuts and scars as so beautiful.

I just want to end my life, i know everyone says “Oh, you’re so young! You have so much left to still discover!”. I’m always complimented on my level of maturity and I know I’m very mature for your average Irish teenager. I know I want to end my life, but I’m still unsure on how to do it.

Life is no longer worth living.,"When I was a young kid, I showed signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder, and it got really bad when I was older (18, right after I graduated high school - the de-stabilizing effect of transitioning from high school to community college messed me up). I always had a low self esteem and have believed in a prophecy that I was never ""meant to"" succeed.

Two years later it got better, but two years after that, I got accepted to a university - yay! But it did the same thing to me. My mental illness relapsed. My OCD this time was more pure-O and the thoughts were absolutely horrible. My grades declined. 

Now, a bit of a back story: I developed a medical problem: long story short, I developed difficulty swallowing (I now have meds for acid reflux but the problem is still undiagnosed). But I would be constantly hungry 24/7, and as a result, unable to focus or concentrate on schoolwork or fall asleep at a reasonable hour. I developed a coping mechanism by drinking homemade fruit smoothies. Unfortunately, however, those are really expensive, and in a year, I turned a $6,300 savings into a $1,200 credit card debt. Even that was not enough to solve the problem, and the ""hangriness"" made the OCD obsessive thoughts worse.

Last summer I got a mechanical engineering internship - hooray! But I thought it was too good to be true, so I sabotaged it. :( I was expected to work 6AM to noon, five days a week, plus a Calculus class 6PM to 9PM, four days a week, plus four hours a day of studying. I failed the class and got fired from the internship for showing up late and being tired on the job.

I am not lazy. I have had several jobs recently where I work 40-50 hours per week in manual labor with little to no issues. But I need someone else to structure my time FOR me. I despise school because of my failures and associate many negative things with it.

A development in my OCD has made me 'guilty' for taking free time. I don't play guitar anymore (when I was 15 I practiced for 90 minutes per day and got extremely good as a result). I wanted to start reading as well - I bought some really cool books almost two YEARS ago - but I haven't gotten around to reading them, because of aforementioned OCD, or guilt that I don't deserve free time. 

I've only relaxed a couple of times this year. All of my ""free time"" is spent being extremely hungry, frantically going grocery shopping for food, preparing food, or making futile efforts to eat said food (often at midnight, 1AM or 2AM). Or just plain feeling guilty for taking free time. I never relaxed. For example, a year ago, I bought a ticket to go see Cannibal Corpse in concert. Even after I had bought the ticket, and even after the concert started, I was still trying to decide whether or not to go.

My parents are also very keen on my grades, because they have not been very good. My dad has threatened to take me out of school if they are not good (but in that case my mom has offered to loan me money for a semester). Plus, the credit card debt. Plus, he told me that unless extreme measures are taken, I will have to take out a loan for school. Plus, I made my dad furious at me for dropping the ball on him and ignoring his texts (due to my anxiety - but I'm afraid he'll just think I'm making excuses).

I have so much anxiety right now that I can't even look at his texts...

I'm 23, and will not experience graduation until I am 26 or 27 because the OCD-based problems have put me behind. I am a failure. My lack of a career has made me an undesirable romantic partner to women. I don't have the will to kill myself but I have the thoughts of it. I have no hobbies anymore, because my mental and physical health have eaten up my free time. I want to be like my 15-year-old self, who always drew really cool artwork out of pure, creative artistic passion. The guy who always pushed himself to get better at guitar. I even got close to learning how to play ""Through The Fire and Flames"" in real life, in its entirety. I want to be that kind of a person again.",ACfireandiceDC,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ab1q6n/life_is_no_longer_worth_living/,12/31/2018/00:34:17,ab1q6n,SuicideWatch

"Does anyone feel like it's easier to go about living, knowing that you can end it all at any given moment?","What I mean to say is, I often find solace in the fact that if it comes to that, I can always just kill myself. It kind of helps me take the next step in life. Thoughts of suicide are always at large inside my head, but I'm not sure that I can actually go ahead with it right now. I have family who care about me a lot, and I really wouldn't want to leave them in a state of despair and confusion, but sometimes the selfishness and the desire to just end it all is fucking overpowering, and knowing that it is an option at all times is slightly consoling, I feel.

      I have depression and anxiety and all the greatest stuff.  I also have an eating disorder. It's hell.  I'm recovering but I still fall back into counting calories and starving myself.  I also have self harm issues.

       I'm getting better now I guess.  I have a significant other.  I have been dealing with gender dysphoria so that's fabulous.  I'm also not straight.  
        My mom is homophobic and she's always yelling at me.  My dad has done some things in the past that were borderline abusive.

Getting deeper support,"I was thinking about how when people contact you online to chat with you for whatever reason, that it usually ends very quickly (at least in my experience). Either the person doesn't respond, or I don't respond because it takes a lot of energy for me to come up with a good response and sometimes I don't feel like doing it. I don't think making internet friends won't help me, because irl friends are more socially fulfilling since they're actually with you in person. 

If you tell someone irl that you're suicidal to try to get support, they're probably going to call the cops and get you put in a mental hospital. If you try to get support online, people can't call the cops on you because they don't even know who you are, but it's difficult to actually make a deeper connection with them.

I could go to the hospital, but all they are going to do there is keep me until I feel safe enough to leave. Nevermind the fact that I won't be able to pay a dollar towards my ER bill, and I even have insurance. Same goes for whatever kind of inpatient programs there are...I miss work for an extended period of time and I'm going to have an extremely difficult time paying my bills.

Done meds and group therapy...obviously not the answer. Individual therapy is the only thing that's worked for me, and even that may not be enough. Just started up with a new therapist, but what about if I fail at that too again?

I don't even know why I'm bothering with this website,"I don't know what to say. I came here before a long time ago but I left. Not sure why I came back. I hate myself. 

I'm a useless, talentless, piece of trash that will never be good enough for anyone and especially not for myself. There is no reason for me to try, at all, at anything anymore. I used to care about drawing and art but not anymore. Now I realize that since other people actually have talent, unlike me, and they understand things like anatomy and shading, there is no reason for me to draw anymore. Fun is not a good enough answer. Why draw for fun? Art isn't fun anymore for me. I can't sit down for more than five minutes without giving up. Just like I give up on everything I do. 

My father was a talented man that supported my family much like my mother is now supporting this family. I try to do things to help around with the house but it's not good enough. My life that I live will not be good enough. It's never good enough. I will always hate myself and I will always feel not as good as everyone else. There is no way in the world I could become the type of artist that both enjoys their work and also makes money. Hell, I couldn't even get a regular job that just makes money to support my mother and I. It's just not gonna happen. I'm a useless piece of trash with zero talent. 

The few friends I made on social media websites aren't really in my life. They don't really seem to give a damn, except for a few people and even then, they have their own problems. They do not wish to be burdened with my petty ego problems. I have food, I have water, and I have shelter but it's still not good enough for me to be happy with myself because what I want to do with my own life I can't do it. I wanted to be a half-decent artist and I was/am involved in video game fandoms and some of those fandoms were just never popular. I wanted to bring them back and even while knowing people in these communities, it didn't amount to much of anything. I can't draw. I don't have money to pay people to draw. I just don't have anything to offer humanity. I don't have a worth ethic and I don't really believe in drawing for fun anymore. 

Everything just sucks. I hate myself because I'm so consumed with my defeatist attitude and yet I can't pull myself up from this despair. My father died of cancer about two years ago and while I have gotten over his death, I am still angry about it. I am still angry that he lived his life helping as many people as possible and God's reward for my father is a disease you cannot fight against. Almost like he died a pointless death. The people he helped in his life don't remember him. They don't care about his struggles. Nobody gives a shit aside from my mother and I. His death is why I refuse to live for anyone else other than my mother and I guess myself. Even though I'm not worth life itself. A talentless hack like me won't do anything with his life. I'm just a worthless high school drop out who can't get a job and wastes his life on toxic social media websites full of people who never have anything good to say about anyone else. 

I'm sick of it. It just seems like it would be easier if I was dead. Why did God create me? Why should a talentless loser like me be forced to live with constantly knowing that he's a talentless loser? People who say if you practice you can get better may be right but I find that hard to believe. I also think talent is a luck thing, something you are born with or you are not born with. Maybe. I don't know. I don't want to believe that but why is it so hard for my hands to draw a proper human body? Why am I so bad at replicating other images people have drawn? Why is my brain so flawed. Why am I so imperfect? I hate it. 

I almost cried today because I was so consumed with my own emotional pain and there is pretty much no one in my life that could help me. My mother doesn't want to hear this negative talk. I don't want to bother with a therapist because that costs money and I don't think a therapist could help me anyways. My friends help, when they can, but it's never enough. They can't fix me. It's not their job to fix me. I need to be able to fix myself but I can't. I'm just not strong enough. I'm not talented enough. And I'm not useful enough to society to even have self-worth to myself. Not having a job made my father feel useless and it's kind of the same thing with me, especially with art. Not being able to draw and especially not being able to learn how to draw makes me sick. I don't even have high standards, I just want to be at a level comparable to some random anime/manga/cartoon/etc. artist on Deviantart. I'm not trying to be the second coming of Michelangelo. 

I just want to be good enough for myself and good enough to love myself. But I don't. I hate myself. I hate that I can't draw and I hate that no one will ever be able to help me. I'm just useless. All the people in my life that were nice to me deserve better than a useless piece of trash like me that has his heart full of nothing but negative emotions. I don't give anything back to anyone. I'm just useless. I'm sorry for wasting everyone's time. I don't even know why I came here. I don't think it's impossible for me to be better and get help and overcome my own personal problems but it just seems so hard and I'm so scared. I'm so scared of trying to do anything with my life so I just stay home, never leave my house, don't try to get a job, don't pursue my own hobbies, and most definitely I have no desire to return to school. Sometimes I just want to die. I'm sorry if my post made anyone sad or feel negative emotions of their own. I do not want to bring anyone else pain or make people feel bad. This is just how I feel inside and the only reason I am here is because the people I have in my life can't do much of anything to help me and I'm desperate. I hope that maybe this long post while be beneficial to at least someone else. Maybe my misery and my pain will give someone else who is struggling some sort of clarity. I don't know. Have a good day, I guess? I'm sorry if that's a stupid thing to say. I'm just rambling right now.

I had a dream.,"Last night I had a dream that I was in a psychiatric hospital. But it wasn’t a nightmare it was completely normal. I honestly couldn’t separate the dream from reality. It was pleasant comforting.  I’m still unsure if it was a signal to me to get some help. And though I’m not religious or believe in fate. But there is a nagging feeling as if my subconscious is trying to tell me to get some help. I’ve had many ups and downs, for more downs and yet. I don’t know what to do. I know I need help, but I’m far to stubborn. So here it is. ",EmeraldTerror68,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aazyrd/i_had_a_dream/,12/30/2018/21:22:01,aazyrd,SuicideWatch

ask for forgiveness from women,  acting like im putting them on a  pedestal or anything.

I don't think anything differently of them. I like talking to all people. I like making people laugh. That's what I love to do but everyone I have ever met has treated me like shit to make themselves feel better and I just want to destroy my esophagus and decapitate myself because I am being funneled out and extinguished by humanity.

I can’t do it anymore,"I feel like I’m not even here sometimes. My best friend left me because she got a girlfriend, decided she didn’t need me anymore or want me because of that and now hates my guts and blocked me. 

It sounds so dramatic but I can’t even get out of bed. Every time I try and go out and act like everything’s fine I feel sick to my stomach.

I cry so much now, I can’t stop thinking about all the memories I have with her and all the stupid funny things we did together and all the conversations we had and

I can’t cope. The day after she left I had to go to school. I left at lunch, went home, drank a 1/4 of a bottle of vodka and cried myself to sleep. All I can think about is ‘who am I going to talk to at 3am now? Who am I gonna send all the funny things I find to now? Who is gonna be there for me now?’ There’s nobody. I just want her back, the pain is so strong. I want to kill myself. I want it all to just end, I can’t deal with this anymore why wasn’t I good enough

I'm on like 4 different meds, and I'm sick of taking them. Two anti-psychotics, one for the illness, one for sleep. An antidepressant, tianeptine, that doesn't work yet or won't work. And some god-awful drug called lorazepam, a benzo.

I've been alone for most of my life. I started feeling intense hate towards everything and everyone when my illness began and I was 16. I don't have friends online or offline, and I'm not particularly interested in keeping social bonds.

I'm dizzy as fuck even right now lying down. I'm tired of feeling dizzy.

You can PM me, if you want to suggest methods for getting better. But, please, no religious bullshit.

Just need to vent and ask,"First of sorry for the long post...

Where to begin? I'm a 32 year old male virgin, I live alone with 2 cats.

Today was actually my 32nd birthday. I've only heard from a few of my family. Which I am grateful for but I know they won't be here forever.
Today if I'm honest has left me feeling really lonely and thinking a lot about what the future has in store. No friends around anymore and no partner to share my time with. I spend a lot of it in my bed these days.

I've been dealing with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts since I was about 24-25. I guess at that point I started to notice something was different about me. 
I've never really been able to put my finger on what that was. Lots of people ""like"" me but I've never really managed to forge lasting friendships past school, my social life is my work and no one has ever seen me as a romantic partner. I really wish I knew why this was. 
Times like this it can all get a bit much. I'm so sick of the same empty house day after day. For once I wish someone would spend sometime with me outside of a work environment. Just normal things, go for a pint go for lunch anything would be good.

I tried antidepressants for a short time but I found they made my behaviour very erratic so I found it best not to take them.
Has anyone here taken them and had positive effects? I'm really feeling stuck now and don't see many options left. It's been a really long time of feeling this way and I'm tired of it, I really am. 

I always wanted a wife and family to love and care for but I'm starting to realise now that's probably not going to happen. At the age I am and the lack of experience I can't see anyone showing interested, they haven't before. 

Even if I have missed the boat for a wife and children can medication stop me from feeling the way I do?

Partner's Suicide,"I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post here, but having never been suicidal myself (other than since my partner's own suicide) I am really struggling to come to terms with the thought process behind my partner's suicide and his actions leading up to it, and thought maybe asking someone who had been ""there"" would give me insight?

I discovered my partner had cheated on me with a prostitute shortly after we had bought and moved into our first (owned) home together. We had been together for a few years and rented together previously. I found a used condom in his pocket and to be honest I totally flipped. I was absolutely devastated. I've been cheated on in the past by another boyfriend, and had insecurities about it happening again, but I had never snooped on his phone or anything as I fully trusted him. I had found the condom because he had a cold and was leaving tissues in all his pockets, and I was putting a wash on. I couldn't believe it, I just never expected it from him. Our relationship seemed solid and we had a great sex life. 

I was unaware he had any mental health issues, and chalked his infidelity up to him not valuing me or the relationship, so I stormed out of the house after some very bitter words and went to stay with a friend. I found him the next morning. 

At his inquest I learnt he had been suicidal once before (before we met) and had taken himself to a&e but been fobbed off with valium. I also found out he had been diagnosed in 2006 with generalised anxiety disorder which he had not sought or received therapy or medication for. 

His sister asked me a very difficult question - she said ""do you think he thought your relationship was over?"". The implication there is that he killed himself because he thought our relationship was over, and I think he must have assumed it was... And that's my fault. I had privately decided to seek a couple's counsellor and to see if we could make it work but I didn't tell him that straight away as I thought he needed to see that he had risked losing me by cheating. I was trying to future proof our relationship by making him think he'd fucked it because I didn't want him to do it again. I travel a lot for work and was terrified he would feel like he could do it again. Needless to say I hate myself for letting him believe it was over. All I can say is I was blinded by my own hurt and never imagined he would do something like this. 

I want to know if any of you have been suicidal after a break up or if it's always a culmination of factors? I know it often happens after breakups, but is that why? He died 12 hours after I had found the condom. He had started googling methods the second I left the house (twenty minutes after finding it and confronting him). If our relationship was life or death  to him, why lay it on the line for the cheapest hooker he could find, just days after completing on our house? I dont understand! Have any of you got generalised anxiety disorder? What is that like? 

I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask these questions. I'm just so devastated to have lost him. I'm so sorry I let him believe it was over. I had no idea he would do this. It's been four months and his pain is all I think about, but I don't fully understand what was going on.

no idea what to do,"im likely losing my job soon since i have no time off to cover a medical absence I had to take for not sleeping/eating/drinking being too exhausted to work. the medical leave isn't being approved so normally you use your time off but i was out for too long.

my girlfriend left me in october. she was my best friend since middle school/highschool. we'd only been dating for a little over a year and a half. i miss her every single day and soon shes going to stop talking to me completely. she says she cant be friends with me once she starts seeing someone else no matter how long shes known me. 

this girl was my everything. not even 3 months before that she was overdosing and trying to jump out of the car while i drove her to the hospital. i made such a deep connection with her over the years and that day especially. almost watching her die, seeing her heart rate skyrocket over 130, 150, bpm, sticking with her through all of it and almost losing her completely it really messed with my head. i was so fucking scared thinking she was about to be gone forever. 

but now she is. and isnt. i can't deal with that at all. i'm stuck in this apartment now with no plan, about to lose my job, the only thing I had left. me and her had plans to move out and get a place together and i held onto that for dear life. i hate my living situation right now for a million different reasons.

now im 6k in debt and that number goes up every single day. i got a traffic ticket last night for going 35+ over the speed limit. where im from it's a class A misdemeanor with up to a year in jail and a $2,500 fine + court fees. i can barely afford rent. everything else has to go on credit cards after i pay my minimum payments and other things like rent that require my cash paycheck. 

i have nobody left in my life. i lost a lot of friends over the past few years, a lot of them because I fell in love with this girl. she dated my best friend for years and years. i still weirdly feel like i betrayed him when they broke up and we got together. 

i've fucked up so many fucking things in my life and i cant even sleep anymore with different ones always popping in my mind. it never stops. i started self harming again months ago and its getting worse. 

what is the fucking point. how do you claw your way back from something like this. in a couple months i might be sitting in jail. nobody will even miss me. nobody will even probably fucking notice. 

i went to juvie when i was a kid and losing my freedom like that, over something i had no control over (I had a catatonic episode from not sleeping for over a week) was traumatizing. i would rather slit my throat then go through that all over again, but seriously this time since im no longer a minor.

Seriously need advice,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this.

I've been on meds for about 6 or 7 months and been doing fine overall. It's the first time I've ever been able to truly function like a normal person and I'm eternally grateful for that.

I've had to be off meds for a while now, though. I'm a dumbass and been a bit too dependent on my parents so I failed to get a follow-up appointment for my medicine and the prescription ended up expiring. I can't get an appointment for a few months now due to scheduling, so I'm just toughing out being off meds.

Even though I'm off meds I'm really not doing too bad. I don't really feel 'normal', I feel like I don't exist most of the time and I've lost most of my motivation. Despite this I can get by and I absolutely can get through the next month or so like this.
However I do get really bad mood swings now that I'm off meds again. I've never really talked completely in depth about this with someone so I'm not sure how normal it is, but I could be completely ""normal"" one moment, my mind accidentally thinks about something I don't like, and instantly I feel the shittiest I've felt in years.
This doesn't really worry me too much, but it's been getting worse lately. Last night right after having a good day I thought about something bad and ended up feeling extremely suicidal and came up with a whole plan to kill myself that night. It took me about 40 minutes to calm down from it, but I got really close to actually trying something, and that scares me to no end. I care a lot about my friends and my animals and I'd never want to hurt them like that.

What I'm posting here for is I need advice for a crisis plan. I don't have a therapist right now and can't see one because of financial reasons. I'd ask my friends but all of them aren't doing too well themselves and I don't want to hurt them or anything. I tried looking at some online but they all don't work for me for some reason or another. There are absolutely no warning signs or build up to my thoughts like that, they come from nowhere and everything happens instantly. I don't know what calms me down from them because I haven't dealt with them in ages. Making an 'emergency appointment' can't help because I live in the middle of nowhere and the crisis be long over before I can get there. I honestly can't do phone calls without getting major anxiety so I really don't think a crisis hotline will help me.
Does anyone have any tips or advice? I really need help and don't know what to do.",subcontrabass_sax,2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aavejc/seriously_need_advice/,12/30/2018/12:08:57,aavejc,SuicideWatch

"Sitting in my bed with a knife nearby, wondering if I should end it all.","I've been a loser my whole life. In k-12, I basically only had 2 friends and I barely hung out with them outside of school. I was the guy who spent all his time at home or in school, never hanging out. Because of that, I have 0 social skills and can't hold a conversation. I am the most boring person ever, so now in college all I have is my GPA but barely any friends (maybe some acquaintances) and no semblance of a romantic life. I've never been on a date, have no idea how to and I'm pretty sure if I ever do go on a date my mind will go completely blank just like it does in every other social interaction and I'll just bore the other person to death. I tried going clubbing several times and I couldn't get a single person to dance with me so it just ends up being a waste of money and time.

I just feel so hopeless. I wanna cry and hug someone and let it all out but I don't think I'm close enough to anyone to do that except my mum who's in a different country who would kill me if she knew I was drinking and going out to clubs and bars. I don't wanna sound too clingy to my closest friend and alienate him. Ideally a romantic partner would be perfect for this (just cuddling and forgetting everything) but a lot of my emotional problems are from a lack of that.

As if that wasn't bad enough, I think I'm starting to develop eating disorders. I've always been somewhat overweight (not obese) but I've been eating so much at my worst so that I don't drink or get high (I enjoy getting high but I'm worried it might make my depression worse) and I've made myself vomit a couple times out of regret. I'm also questioning my gender and sexual identity, but I can't ever live as those if they're not cis hetero because I come from an ultra conservative nation.

Seriously, my life is fucked and the only thing stopping me from ending it all is not wanting to be the disappointment of the family and hurting my mum.

People always talk about their success stories, how they ""found their person"" after years of crying and praying. What they DON'T talk about are people like me. The rejects. The socially inept motherfuckers that just want to live. Yeah, those guys get nothing. No matter how they try and change to fit the object of their affections, they get nothing. 

Society rejects people all the time. My room is in the attic, so nobody will know for at least a few days. Let's see where this goes. ",LostProxy7,4,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aau33l/love_is_fake/,12/30/2018/07:56:04,aau33l,SuicideWatch
"Sometimes, I don’t feel like living anymore.","Nearly everyday, there’s a voice in my head telling me I should just get it over with. My own internal voice. 

I tried to kill myself the first (and only time) when I was fifteen. I had been brutally beaten, raped, and left for dead near my parents home two years earlier. I got up, walked home, cleaned myself up, and told them I fell out of a tree.

When I finally had the courage to tell my parents what happened? My Mother called me a “whore” and my Dad tried to claim I had “wanted it”.

I was raised uber Mormon and homeschooled so I didn’t even know what sex was until I was raped, so no, I wasn’t a “whore” and I didn’t “want it”.

I left home at 16 for obvious reasons and never went back.

I survived an abusive marriage and had a child. I survived cancer at 28. Then, at 30, survived being hit by a car whilst training for a triathlon on my bicycle. I was thrown face first through the windshield of a car, breaking my cheekbone, eye socket, nose, jaw, rupturing my sinus cavity, rupturing four spinal discs, and destroying my right quad. 

I have a 16 year old son with autism who was abused by his dad and step mother when his dad filed for more custody after I developed cancer. 

I’ve spent seven years trying to fix what they did to him.

Every day, I hate myself a little more. The blinding pain I am in every day makes me throw up, daily.

I hate waking up because I’m in pain.

My son is becoming the most horrible person because of the abuse he endured and there’s really nothing more I can do for him.

I hate that I’ve struggled so long and for what?!? To live in a broken/battered shell while I watch my only child become a monster?

The one thing keeping me going is my son and he’s just awful.

For a bit of backstory: I am 20, ftm, Im a professional artist, and im openly suicideal. I have serve obsessive compulsive disorder that involves constant thinking about suicide and self harm and my currently only releasing compulsion - cutting. on top of this i also have fibromyalgia - so im just in consistent pain and i want to die.

I was severely neglected all throughout my childhood by my parents, including them turning a blind eye to my grandfather molesting me. my mom always worked, my dad was always busy, and my siblings hated my guts. 
When i was 9 my mom passed away and my dad became an alcoholic, so i had to start looking after him and his declineing health. we finally got close. it was me and him agenst the world and i  trusted him with everything - so i told him i am transgender. He ended up throwing me to the streets and i was homeless for a year. I ended up with this guy, who ended up being verbally abuseive torward me and, he too, threw me out like garbage.

Throughout all this i had a very close freind, W. He was another trans guy and i slowly ended up trusting him. we went out- we had plans to get married and for the first time in my life i was happy. he was my absolute everything.  A few months ago he left me for a girl - someone just a town over so that he could fuck someone real.

Im just fucking garbage. im useless and worthless and im never going to get close to someone again. I dont believe my story has a happy ending.

"2 years later, I’m still in agony","I did 16 years in the US Navy. During my last couple years, I was stationed as an Instructor in Pensacola, FL. 

2 years ago, Thanksgiving, I was standing a routine watch. A watch I’d stood a dozen times before. Watch the desk, watch the phones, makes sure the kids don’t burn the place down. 

Toward the end of my watch, my relief was near, a young 18 year old Vietnamese kid comes to the office with suicidal ideation. I bring him in and do my best to console him and get information out of him. I try to help him and give him advice. He’s homesick and misses his family. I try to be sympathetic and help him but he’s so closed up. I can’t get anything out of him. I make the professional decision and have him taken to medical under escort so he can be seen by professionals.  He snowballs Medical and they release him. 

A week later, he hangs himself in his barracks room.

2 years later, I’m still crying over it. I’ve disappointed people. I’ve made people angry. I’ve hurt people. But I’ve never felt like I truly failed someone until this young man. 

His death haunts me to this day and I lay awake many a night crying because of his death and the guilt I have from it.

Thought s of a dying person aka m e don't read,"I lost game over friend this life is the worst bullshit that has ever happened to m e wow wow can't remember a single moment in which I was happy
Actually I can
It was with people I have lost
I remember when I shared the bed with a man for the first time I remember looking into his big blue eyes thinking I never want to stop getting lost into them I remember we were going to sleep in each others arms and I didn't want to sleep fearing I would miss a precious moment and then boom I got dumped like a week later lolololol it took me a year to get over it A YEAR can you imagine... 3/4 months of relationship .. a year to get over it ... Haahahahah what an idiot. I thought "" maybe  this  time 
i will actually be happy and be loved"" what an idiot. Remember when I was hospital ized in a psychiatric hospital I hated my parents so much for doing that to me. I really did. I hated that place. With all my heart. I lied at the tests they made me take. I lied didn't want people to know how suicidal I was and am. Hahha the psychiatrist was angry because I wouldn't open up and she kicked off at me???.. I remember when I broke someone.... I was so little but so evil.... I was 13 and basically a little kid.mm this """"friend of mine"" was basically a bitch I couldn't stand and she made a nastu comment on my brother's glasses so I got home and made a video in which I called her a beached whale... And uploaded it on YouTube... Then I showed it to people... You should have seen the look on that poor girls face. She was crying she was broken WHAT HAVE I DONE?? I THINK THE WORLD IS STILL PUNISHING ME FOR THAT.MM  yes I am evil and I have sinned... Punish me world for I am the worst person that could have ever inhabited this world. I want to see my blood stain the walls and pavement I want to drown in my blood I want to feel the cold embarce of death . Death come closer. I know you soooo well death. We see each other everyday but we never really touch the moment we doz it's the end for me I die. I wonder why people are so stupid and retarded. ""You make me feel guilty xdxdxd"" then when I tell them I'm suicidal they yell at me and tell me I'm a burden I'm pathetic I should just die. Yes I know. Go on please. I want you to push me over the edge. Haven't had a shower in a week, too depr seed to get up from the bed. You know people talk about depression as if it was just sadness but it's not. Death is cheap one second you're here the next you're gone. I've been craving for that feeling of peace. Maybe then I would be loved. People only love you when you're dead haha. I can't wait can't wait to be loved. I wanna be buried next to my nana. I'm sorry nana I'm so sorry. Burn my remains and throw the ashes in the toilet. I don't deserve to be remember. I don't deserve to be loved. Oh world why was I bound to die like this? All this year's all this hope was for nothing. Life... Life ... What is it... A lie. One big lie. All I gotta do is take a step forward. And then I'm gone. GONE. For good. Good lord. If you really exietz , safe me. Give me something good. Someone who will save me.

I am a burden and feel trapped,"My life fucking sucks. I have a single mother so we often times struggle with money. We can’t afford health insurance so we can’t afford a therapist for me.  She doesn’t know how fucking depressed I am and my frequent suicidal thoughts. I hate my stupid job so much and am only keeping it because I want to save up money for wrestling training for when I turn 18. Which is an unrealistic dream of mine given our financial state. I was planning on going to community college and doing the wrestling on the side, but idk if that would be a good idea. I don’t know. I just want to do something that makes me happy. I don’t want a shitty career I hate. I also see what it’s like to struggle with money and also don’t want that as well. 

 I was so excited for this break from school only to be spending time with my family(I love my family don’t get me wrong but I need a break) and working the days I’m not. I just want to relax for a second. My mom wants what is best for me and I often times try to confide in her about certain things but she isn’t a therapist and doesn’t know how to respond in the best possible way and ultimately makes me feel worse(this isn’t her fault she’s not doing this intentionally). I really feel like a burden to her even though I know she really loves me I sometimes wonder if she would be better off without me. She pays for my schooling(which we can’t fucking afford), she pays for all of the WiFi bills(she wouldn’t have without me because she would cut it), I probably run up all of this shit we can’t afford and without me she wouldn’t have to worry about money or anything. 

I love my friends but if I ever told them this they would be of no help. My brain is just fucked up and I am trying to help it. I really want to die sometimes and right now it is at its peak. There’s more I’m not mentioning here to keep the anonymity but I just don’t want to be here. Working 6 hours tomorrow and then working again New Year’s Eve.

It got so bad to the point where I started cutting, and they accused me of begging for attention. Like, no, fuck you and your attention. I cut myself because it helps me validate my pain, while everyone else shrugs it off.

Everything's ready,"I wrote a suicide message to my fresh exbf. Just for him. He's the only person who I really felt a connection with, that really helped me and the person I'(ve) love(d) the most. He started going off at me, calling me pathetic, a burden, grow up, etc etc. 🙄

So my plan of leaving with ""beautiful words"" as my last words fucking crumbled but I have a plan B.

I wrote a little letter and in the early morning I'm mailing it to him, with my favourite plushie which I've had since I was a kid and my phone. Just something to remember me by, I guess, if I really did matter, and I want my lil monkey plush to be with the most important person I've had in my life. That way my real last words will be the letter and not the stupid argument we just had.

Ten years,"I have a 12.5 year old daughter. She was the product of a woman lying about taking her birth control to get pregnant after our 1 year relationship was coming to a close. It has ruined my life. I was headed to college. I am trans and was never able to transition because when I became a father the money and time costs were so much. On top of that she left me and had three more kids by two more dudes. My daughter suffers because of her which kills me. I am so poor. I have to live where the job is and I hate this place. I hate my job. I hate my life. I am so lonely. I am not even able to be the real me. I wish for death every day. I hope some days, but it always fails. The most recent being this holidays.  But nothing ever comes of it all. I am so poor. I just want out. I just want to give up. But it would hurt my daughter so much I think. So I have decided ten years. If she is 22 and in college, hopefully maybe even done with college I will do it then and you know what? I won’t feel bad for it at all. I will be proud I lasted through hell so long for her. If I can make it ten more years i will do it and without a shred of guilt or remorse. Just ten more years.

A musing about what it would be like if I told my family about my struggle with suicidal thoughts,"**Using a throw away account because my family knows my handle.**

Sometimes I like to write quick “musings” or thoughts that are occupying my mind. Lately I’ve been pondering about truly opening up to my family about my struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts (I promise I’m fine and know how to get help when I need it). One of the things that I struggle to articulate is how suicidal thoughts are not a one time thing for me, but rather a constant niggling in the back of my mind that becomes loudest when I am weakest. I liken it to fighting a war. Each day is a battle, but every day that I win does not represent the end of the war. 

I wanted to share this musing about what it would be like to tell my family about my struggle with suicidal thoughts because I feel as though this is one of the only places it will be understood. 

What if I told you?

What if I told you I was suicidal? Would you shout at me? Angry and afraid at the thoughts you do not understand and cannot control. Would you cry? Internalizing the responsibility for the thoughts that I have. Or would you pass over the admission as if I was simply asking you to pass the salt during dinner?

Would you treat me differently? Would secrets begin to grow as you worry over which truth would push me over the edge? Forcing a rose colored tint to the world as a growing sense of paranoia begins to take hold of me. Or would each day forward be treated as our last? Hugs would be given freely and frequently. No words would be left unspoken as you ensured I always felt as though I belonged and was not breakable.

Would you see me as broken? Not recognizing the strength it has taken for me to win against the constant onslaught of my suicidal thoughts every, single, day. Not recognizing that it is merely a broken record of lonely, self-loathing litanies repeating in my head. Merely needing a gentle hand to reach out and nudge the needle back into place to continue along the record.

Would you seek the help our family needs to move past the wounds that fester? So willing are we to apply band aids to the wounds, but so afraid are we to treat the root of our pain. So it sits, day by day, the would slowly growing until it is too big for any band aid to contain.

Would you be able to see past your guilt? Understanding that there is no blame to be assigned. That my desire to commit suicide does not represent a failing in either you or I. This desire is simply a need to feel accepted, to know unequivocally that I belong, that I have a purpose, and will flourish.

But in the end, would anything be any different if I told you? 

Would anything really change?

"Some days ago I thought everything would be alright, but now I’m scared the thoughts are coming back","19th December I went to psychiatric hospital for kids and young. I really felt hope, and really felt like everything was going to get better and that I would be able to get the help I need.

I thought I will finally start to school again after the holidays 3rd January.

25th December I was outside and walked 10k meters.
Same thing on 27th.

I was genuinely happy and life really looked good. Now I’m scared again. I’m scared the happiness I felt was just me building up to another really bad breakdown. And now my mood is going downhill again.

I was thinking of going to school on the 3rd, but I just look so fat and ugly. I have gained weight since last time people saw me.

Hello!," I'm pretty sure I'm far from the level of problems some people here expose, but today I hit a new low and I feel the need to complain(?), eventhough I feels weird to write this on the internet... So I'm a University student. Curently doing my masters degree. Got exams for the whole month of January so I often stay up all night trying to study. And I'm really not suceeding at it. At all. It's a lot of things to study and time is running out. Also I have a weekend job (my first ever). I work in a supermarket in the cold meats section. I'm not the best, but I always try to learn from mistakes and costructive criticism, since the job is the only place where I feel like I'm doing something well. Besides, it's keeping my family afloat now that we started having more unavoidable expenses. Nonetheless, despite me trying my best my boss called me today saying I don't meet expectations, according to what she heard from my coworkers, and basically if I don't become better she won't renew my contract. And what can I say... I now started doing shop closings, and I'm kinda lost, since there's a lot of things to know and no one really explained it all the right way, which made her really mad once (I'm doing much better now). I also had some disagreements with some people who weren't doing things like they should and I have a gut feeling they've been talking shit about me too, out of spite. Basically a hostile environment. So yeah, no sleep, expecting failure in university, fearing getting unfairly fired. At home I've became lazy and unmotivated. I think it will just become worse. My life can potentially collapse completely. I started cutting myself again but today, for a while, I just felt like giving up completely, after all, I won't become a fucking burden for my parents. I had a few friends but distanced myself from them for different reasons and if I tell this to my parents they'll likely get mad and nothing good will come out of that.. I'm the definition of a failure right now.. I hope I don't sound needy, but I really need some words of encoragement and reassurance, maybe some tips, I don't know...

Last call into the void. Or a suicide note.,"Don't know which it ends up being, yet.

I'm sorry, to everyone who finds it. I am the most worthless person I know.

I just want to be loved. In a romantic way. I know I'm not worth it. Everyone I know is. But not me, never me.

I am done. I've tried too many times. It hurts. It hurt the first time I loved someone. When I knew I never was liked even. That I would not be loved. I had hope, and I had it crushed. It hurt when that person came back, and breathed hope back into me, just for it to be crushed, again.

It hurts every time I try meeting new people just wanting to be loved. And I'm never needed. Especially not irl. Online I can spend time with people, but nobody ever wants it to go offline.

It hurts every time people complain about their relationship problems, and I just sit there. Unable to say anything. Unable to relate. Because I never will be in one. Because I am worthless. It hurts every time I'm reminded of that. Especially now.

It hurts every time people tell me that I am somehow worth someone's attention and love. Because they lie. I am not worth theirs. It's always ""someone"" that is not them. Or, in case of my parents, they try to make me feel good. And they lie. Try to tell me I have redeeming qualities yet at the same time berating those when I feel better. Like my appearance.

It hurts every time people say ""you just need time, finish a degree first"". I don't want a degree. When I get it, I'll be wasting my life in a job >8 hours a day 5 days a week. I won't have time. I don't want any of that, I just want love. And I'm not worth any. Degree or no degree. Maybe I'm worth being deceived and leeched on for money while being cheated on, but not loved.

It hurts every time my attempts are quasi (or regularly)-ghosted. Every time I express interest in someone and they never reply to me after a short dialogue. It hurts every time people have the decency to reject me, because most times they lie about why they did.

It hurts when people complain about their situations. Whether as a response to me, or if they simply do. I always want to say ""at least you are loved. Wanna switch? I'll sort out your problems in a couple months"". But I can never switch. And never will be able to.

It hurts me every time I talk to people online, because that's the only way I can, and I'm rejected at the end. When I have little bits of hope, when I have a little fun, and get crushed.

It hurts me every time people say I just want attention. Because I do. I'm ready to give it back, too. But I just don't deserve any.

I don't want no afterlife. I don't want to get better. I'm so afraid of the quantum immortality-type scenario, that I can not escape my consciousness because I can't ever experience being unconscious. I don't want help. I don't want to see everyone celebrating new years with the people they love, the people that love them back. I just want to go. To disappear.

I will try, soon. It's 5 am here now. I slept for a bit. I will hopefully cry myself into sleep some more, then wake up, leave home and do it. It hurts, because I will wound everyone I love and make them feel responsible. I am afraid of a cascade of suicides among the people I love that I will probably cause.

I'm sorry. I hope not to change my mind. I'm sorry for being rude to y'all in these words. I just... Want to speak what I think one last time.

I care for y'all. I'm sorry it's this way. I wish it could be different. I wish there was no pain in this world. Have a good 2019, everyone.",Morphie12121,3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aars16/last_call_into_the_void_or_a_suicide_note/,12/30/2018/02:25:14,aars16,SuicideWatch

Today is my last day alive,"I do not want sympathy or people to say don't do it. I am not looking for attention or a saviour, and I am not really even sure why I'm writing this. I have been thinking about doing this for the last six or so months now, and it will honestly be a relief to remove this thought from my mind. A culmination of things has brought it on; stresses of college assignments, NVQ, work, driving, no general pleasure or control in life- I have no friendly and am pretty much isolated from my whole family. Despite working my ass off for two years I'm no better off. So today it seems fitting for me to end it all, new years eve. It's relieving to know the end is near, and I can have one big party and do what I want for a night, smoke, drink, maybe even drugs before and just let go. I have told my one group of associates one of who I consider a brother for college and my father about this, it is none of your faults, though I doubt you will ever read this.

can't wait to die [m17],"everytime i sit down to write i never get around to ever finishing what i say. fuck it, or even what i think. whatever it is makes me want to fucking die. i hate everything

guess thisll work as my sucide note if anyone ever finds this. mom, pops, youre terrible people and i hope you fucking rot. i never loved you or respected you because whenever i showed it, you told me to be grateful for the things i have compared to others. i don't have anything to be grateful for. i hate everything. i don't want to live

as a child i was raised christian in an asian household. pressured very strong to be the perfect child doctor prodigy or some shit and cure cancer. its unbeaten to this day for a reason, mom. i used to be a kid where i didnt have to try to get good scores. or at least i didnt care because i was learning and i loved it. math was easy, life was great

then came the day that i still remember to this day. it was an ordinary day but it hit me as something so special i couldn't describe it and i still can't. i sat on a bench in the middle of school with a classmate and contrmplated the future. that was the first time i ever noticed time was going quickly and i had no control over that. freedom was a scary concept too, how there was no backup plan for total freedom. it all just crashed upon my 4th grade 10 year old mind but i never really thought about it.

i still remember that moment

god i hate it

i hate it because i wished time would pass faster. i hate it because that was the first time i noticed my life was the same repeating cycle of breakfast, school, homework, and dinner. every single day of the four years before that were the same.

every single day that i live right now looks the same. 

one could say i have control over my life by being uber productive and ahering to a schedule

i dont have a choice

i was raised without choice

i cant make decisions

and it fucking sucks

well fast forward 8 years, im a senior ready to graduate high school. i thought applying to college woule be easy. its not.

now im reflecting on what i did...

nothing cones up

i want to fucking die

every day was the exact same , there is nothing to remember

i have no awards for being smart, clever, hardworking or anything

nothing to prove for it at all


i want to die

how am i supposed to be perfect if ive nothing to show for 18 years of life

what's the point

ive lost all my interests and im now failing math. i cant socialize enough to ask questions and i dont understand basic concepts. i wasnt pushed enough as a child or something. guess im the asshole  

i want to be an art student, i live video. but i cant. im too scared of not having a future. my subconscious dad tells me that i need to have money. he penny pinches all the time.

thats also why i cant make decisions. overcontrolling parents and no control over money. my parents yell over tiny amounts of money.

when i make a bad decision about anything which directly involves money, my dad weasels his way out by saying i didnt ask. or that he would have paid for it. but i dont care. he says go ahead if its a good value . but if he cant explain what the fuck a good value is then i cant fucking help. good value my fucking ass

back to religion. atheist in an entirely strictly religious household. doesnt help that im fucking gay too

disassociation is also a huge thing for me too... dont know what else to call it. its where i suddenly feel like im watching someone perform life from afar. probably has to do with the routine garbage. i cant feel anything anymore. i am numb to everything

when i was a kid i read so many sci fi books about successful people and the entire world changing after a  certain event or whatever. guess i got brainwashed to think that could have been me one day. i was naive and stupid to think that. probably has something to do with the routine disassociation or whatever

plus whats the fucking point in living if were going to die anyway at the end.

every day is the same. routine is killing me. the pressure of perfectness is killing me. religion fucking sucks. the world is shit. i cant change yet my entire world can, and nobody fucking cares.",suicidethrowaway482,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aarccj/cant_wait_to_die_m17/,12/30/2018/01:30:54,aarccj,SuicideWatch

I hate myself as a person. I hate how I look.,"I'm a 20 year old virgin male, still living with mom and stepdad.

 I am unattractive; my face is long and chubby, it looks exactly like an eggplant, I have no cheekbones so my eyes have big bags under them and I look like an elderly Slavic man,  my nose is severely broken to the side and one of my nostrils are flared open, I basically look like an orangutan. Yet my long chubby face is off-put by my extremely skinny disproportionate body. My hair is also extremely fine to the point where you can see my bare skull if it's not styled a certain way.

Second, my personality is toxic. I am EXTREMELY socially anxious, I talk to nobody at my workplace and when I do I come off as very awkward and naive, I honestly think I have Aspergers. Everyone at my workplace avoids me like the plague, and the people who do talk to me talk to me like a child. I ruminate all day over this and beat myself up 24/7. I am unappreciative of those around me who actually care about me, and I'm always trying to seek validation from other strangers, even if it's just fantasizing about it.

I have no goals, no aspirations, no motivation, nothing. I lost all my old friends, they even called me 'weird' and 'alien-like' because of how I behaved around them. All I do is play videogames and smoke weed. I was given an IQ test by a psychiatrist and scored 124, which definitely boosted my self-esteem, yet I feel like I have 0 common sense because I come off like an idiot in front of the people I work with and never seem to remember anything. And this isn't from smoking weed, because I've been like this for as long as I can remember. 

I am going to school this January for welding and have no idea how I'm going to survive even a week in there. I have no desire to weld yet it's my last chance for any type of formal education. I graduated highschool with a 2.5 gpa. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember which is basically the main reason I performed so poorly in school.

Also, as a nice cherry on top, my dad died unexpectedly just a couple months ago. The most important person in my life, and my best friend. I am absolutely done with everything and have no idea what to do. I am seeing a therapist but I feel like it has hardly made much of a difference, talking with him is just me venting and him making me question my own thoughts, which end up in me sort of 'agreeing' with his point despite my doubt. 

I have honestly considered electroshock therapy. I feel like a hollow husk of a human. I am constantly deducing things about myself and feel constantly stuck in my head. I feel like I already know the purpose of life and why things exist and I'm bored with it. I will never believe in a god. I feel useless.

It seems after my exit from active military it has been monthly the thoughts of suicide come in my head. 

It doesn’t really matter if I tell people I have I a Plan or not. no one really seems to care anymore.  I am just another struggling veteran. I have called the suicide hotlines not only only for veterans but also the normal hotlines.  Since I live in Germany (because of my two kids... also the only two reasons I have never followed through) neither really care. Now I just drink as much alcohol as possible that when my depression hits I am to drunk to actually do anything.  Perhaps a sense of self protection, I don’t know or care anymore. 

As a veteran that receives monetary benefits because of that depression, I have yearly check-ups with the VA.  This year, even though I have called more than one hotline in a crisis situation the VA has decided to cut my benefits as it is no longer needed...  In addition the Country of Germany where I and my kids live (my kids live with my ex-wife, divorce also a effect of my depression) has decided I am no longer welcome. 

I honestly don’t know why I try anymore to push through the thoughts of suicide, when honestly no one really cares. Kids are to young to really understand anyways.  

If I really get kicked out of the country where my children live, I think it is time to make my plans active. 

If you think this is a joke I can send pictures of the tree I plan to drive my car into at a speed of atleast 80mph.  Have tried and planned, I know it will work.

I want to die and feel like no one understands,"Today I saw some of my friends after a long time. We had a lot of fun but after going home I just felt worse than normally. I don't know why. I attempted suicide about three weeks ago and every day I'm reminded how I couldn't even do that right. I really want to die and I stay awake every night just feeling sorry for myself. My friends have said that I can always talk to the when I'm feeling bad but I just can't. I don't know how to talk about my feelings. But even if I did, I feel like my friends don't understand that I'm 100% serious about it. Until I slit my own wrist they thought I was just a bit sad and joked about suicide.  
I'm too afraid to even tell my therapist that I actually want to die because she'll just ask why, why, why. I don't know! I don't even care! I just want to not feel like shit all the time. But I'm afraid that if I kill myself my little sister will follow, because she seems depressed, so what I've been thinking is disappearing without a trace and then killing myself somewhere where I will not be found.
I don't know what to do. I don't want to live. I don't want to put my family through all that grief that my death would probably cause them but I was never a good child and didn't get along my parents when I was a kid, I just cried and got mad and broke stuff.

My mother is the only string keeping me alive,"I’ve wanted to die for quite some time now. Not because of the reason you might think; not because I think the world would be better off without me, or because I get bullied, or because of any of the normal generic reasons. I have a pretty average, social life. I want to die for quite the opposite reason- because I want to live. I believe there must be something after death. My biggest reason for believing this is how the universe came to be. There must be some greater force at play here, even if it’s not an almighty, all seeing, all powerful God. But I just don’t think the universe is some sort of cosmical coincidence in which things just happened to go in just the right way for it to exist. However, that could be a possibility, I just don’t personally believe in it. Have you ever watched Re:Zero? It’s about the life of a young man that gets transported from his boring life to a different world, and has the ability to come back to life when he dies. You could say that anime may be clouding my perception, and I’d agree. However, I can still tell the line between reality and fantasy. I know something like that is not possible _in this world._ But what if something like Re:Zero could happen? No one knows if it is like that or not. However, my mother. She’s the only reason I haven’t killed myself. I love my mother more than anything in this world. If not for her, I would’ve moved on a long time ago. I feel like if I killed myself she would feel as if she failed as a mother, when in reality it’s my own problems that led me there. She has my brother, though. I know I can, in no way, be replaced to my mother, but my brother could certainly help alleviate the loss that would derive from my passing.

My Suicide Note,"Dear Everyone,

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Don't blame yourself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This has been a long time coming.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Those of you that dont know of everything are probably shocked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Those of you that did probably arent. Youre just sad. Or angry. Or maybe you are shocked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It looked like I was getting better. Maybe you thought I was happy. I kind of thought that I was happy too. Maybe I was.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even still, this hole has existed in my heart for years. It expands and deepens and I've been trying to fill it all this time. Nothing could have ever filled it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Love, alcohol, knowledge, mindless tasks.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thoughts in the back of my mind keep creeping up. I've been pushing them back for so long and I just couldnt do it anymore.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm really sorry.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ive been putting it off for so long due to fear. Fear of pain and the unknown. Fear that all of you would blame yourselves. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I know that some of you still will. Im telling you not to. It's not your fault. It's not. There is nothing more you could have done for me. Nothing would have fixed me. Nothing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Please, dont blame yourself. Blame me. Blame me for not being strong enough. Blame me for not being able to do it anymore. Blame me. Hate me. Please.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Goodbye.

I'm really out of options here.,"So I'm gonna be pulled from my medication that was keeping me from being suicidal, due to that medication having toxic side effects (as in a possibility of kidney failure). I've tried every bloody medication I can at this point, I've had six-eight years of the therapy, I've not touched alcohol or illegal drugs, I've even tried just having a good diet, exercise etc. *Nothing works*, except for this one damn pill... that I'm now being told I have to stop taking... because, oh, everyone would prefer me alive and utterly miserable/suicidal, as opposed to happy for a short time.   


I'm not critical/about to end it as some here are, more just seeing the inevitable suicide coming from some way off and cringing well in advance. I really am feeling like I'm dead either way at this point, though, and at least if I ended it myself I'd finally feel like I had some control over my damn life.

Just a post,"I really didn’t want to post and seem like I was seeking attention. Honestly I don’t even know why I’m posting right now. I guess maybe I just want to share how I feel. I feel alone really flipping alone. Most of my life was never the most popular person. Until these past couple years where I became the party/rager frat bro that everyone loved. Just a few months later and man am I fuckin alone. My ex couldn’t give a single fuck about me, the bro’s are all too caught up in their relationships to do much else. Hell even my closest friend, she’s seriously beautiful and seriously one of a kind is just that just my friend. When I was at the top before I guess I never really saw it coming back down, I was almost sleeping with 6 girls a week at one point. But none of that mattered then and none of that matters now because hey I’m here on winter break in my bathroom on my shower floor drinking and crying because I just feel so fucking alone.

I got horribly lucky to even land a job (no idea why they hired me when I said I didn’t know about the job) and had to apply like crazy to get the current school I’m in (doing another degree. New country. Needed new scenery but thinking this was a bad idea now. The school is the kind that accepts anyone really). Recently got rejected again when applying for new job and with a girl.

Concerned about a brother’s classmate. Is there anything I can do?,"So earlier today, my (20F) brother (12M) told me that his friend (same age) is suicidal. He told me that she self harms and has rope marks on her neck. When I asked him what his reaction is, he said that whenever she feels like she wants to or is going to kill herself, my brother talks to her and that he’s the only person who can talk her out of it. I don’t know her name, just age.

It’s crazy that this is happening at 12, but I stayed calmed in front of my brother. But I’m freaked out. I feel like I should have asked him more questions or said something, but I didn’t know what and the conversation moved on.

Which brought me here. I want to help or at least give my brother some advice, but don’t know what. Our mum has strong negative opinions on suicide, so tell her would do nothing. Same with the high school (I finished there last year). A kid tried to commit suicide last year and a teacher just yelled at them. I don’t think the school is fit to help them. What should I do and how do I press the issue again with my brother?",Squishy_Pixelz,4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aaqh0e/concerned_about_a_brothers_classmate_is_there/,12/29/2018/23:50:02,aaqh0e,SuicideWatch

Why I want to die,"Although I am not planning on doing it today, I know that I am most likely to die from suicide.
I am a 20-year US Special Operations Veteran.  I also spent almost 10 years working on private military contracts in the Middle East.  So, what did all that service to my country get me?  PTSD, anger, and soul-crushing depression.  I am so tired of dealing with it.  The pain never goes away.  I have been to therapist.  I have done Cognitive Behavior Therapy.  I have taken different anti-depressants: Zoloft, Paxil, Venaflaxin, and now Wellbutin.  They work for a short time and then the depression monster builds back up and creeps into your mind to remind you as to what a piece of human garbage you are.  It tells you that this is it.  Life is never going to get any better.  It is hopeless.
I have spoken to both civilian as well as veteran suicide hotlines.  The civilian ones follow a script that doesn’t help except to tell you to seek professional help. (Gee, thanks Ann Landers). The veteran hotline was not any better.  There the guy on the other end was basically, “Suck it up”.  So, that wasn’t very helpful.
The Veteran’s Administration is trying to help but they also seem try to fit you into a box.  Not as a criticism, but I am not so sure how well their programs work.  From my own personal experience, not too well.  If 20 veterans are committing suicide every day, then I would have to question their program.
I also have to question the support they receive from this current administration.  Much as Trump talks about loving the military, his actions speak much louder.  He doesn’t like soldiers who get captures so I imagine he is not crazy about those that get wounded or killed either.  Personally, I think he is a physical coward and a bully so I would expect nothing of substance from him.  His one and only visit to a war zone (I think in the middle of the night and for about three hours) he used as a campaign rally.  Not what I would expect to hear from a leader.
The doctors tell me to trust them, it will get better. It hasn’t.  They want to take away the one and ony medicine that has actually helped me when I needed it, a benzodiazepine.  
I don’t believe in God so please don’t tell me to pray.  If you had seen some of the horrible suffering I have witnessed first-hand, to innocent people who are not combatants, you would not believe either.  Because, why would a loving and just God, allow innocent people, I am talking babies and toddlers, to be maimed or their parents killed and they are left on their own, to suffer those horrors?  I was raised Catholic but I left religion a long time ago.  None of it makes sense anyway.
I see terrible people do terrible things and prosper while I see good men and women suffer.  Life is not fair.  I know.  But really, why do we award assholes?
So, while my mind is sinking deeper and deeper into despair, I have to wonder what is all of this therapy trying to accomplish?  All of my problems and personal failures that have accumulated throughout my lifetime are always going to be there.  People say, “Don’t look back, only forward”.  Nice thought but it doesn’t help me with my problems.  We are who we are based on our past.  Often those mistakes and failures continue to impact us as long as we live. 
Finally, regardless of what anyone says, mental illness carries a huge stigma.  And this is why we, the ones suffering with mental illness, don’t talk about it.  If you bring it up, people never look at you the same.  You are looked at as weak.  In the military, if you ask for help, you might as well kiss any promotions away because they will look at you as unfit for duty.  A physical wound is treated with respect.  A psychological wound it looked down upon.  You are taught for years to push through the pain, complete the mission not matter what, your mind will overcome any obstacles.  Well, it is your mind that is now wounded.  You, as the sufferer, feel shame with yourself and that you are weak.  That is the whole culture.  Oh, they may talk a good game but the reality is much, much different.  You are cast as a loser.
In the civilian world, if you say you want to kill yourself, then they can throw you into a hospital for 72 hours.  And now you have a record.  That is sure to help in any background investigation for a job!  
There is no winning.  None.  So, why not kill myself.  I am much closer to the end of my life, age-wise, than the beginning.  I am going to die anyway.  Why not just let me do it.  In fact, I wish they would help us accomplish it with the minimum of pain and suffering. For God’s sake, they worry about causing murderers pain when executing them.  We mentally ill patients, they want to keep us alive as we continue to suffer with our demons.  I can only think it is to make them feel better about themselves at our expense.
I am not having a good life.  I suffer every waking moment.  I just want the pain to end.
Either truly help us or help us die peacefully and painlessly.

26 and trying to turn things around,"I want to start by saying I love you all very much. I wanted to thank you for taking time to read this. I read long and short posts on this form often and really appreciate people who are suffering from depression or suicidal feelings to open up and talk to other people going through the same. Your experiences and struggle mean so much to me. Your strength and ability to get feedback on how to cope is very inspiring to me. It always has been. This post is somewhat typed fast though I feels like it's a good place for me to start.

A little about my past.  I struggled with depression and emotional/learning disabilities in my youth. I have been diagnosed with a learning disability which effects me in a profoundly negative way along with bipolar. Looking back at my early life I was very troubled. I remember getting into random fits of crying and generally struggling in school despite being a very creative and talented person. By middle school I was attending a special education school. I disliked it and wanted to start a “normal life” 

Starting high school was very thrilling for me. It was the first time I was going to get to meet friends and be integrated in the community. I was a bit of an outcast but I was always nice to people and was somewhat popular. People were attracted to my charisma and creativity. Despite struggling with grades because of my learning disability I was immersed in the arts. I was convinced that though I struggled with grades in the “future” I would be a success in the film production industry because of my hardworking demeanor. Perhaps it was during this time I made some mistakes. I started smoking pot during this time and would skateboard a lot. In retrospect this was a waste of my time. These were some of the best years of my life though at the time I could not see it.Then, during the recession of the late 2000’s my family had to move. We relocated to Virginia. It was very hard for me as a senior and I became very depressed. I was rejected from all of the colleges I applied to and began attending community college after high school. It was during this time I made a huge mistake that will haunt me for life of expressing that I was suicidal to friends and loved ones. My friends at first were supportive though in time became turned off my negative thoughts and feelings. In retrospect I was an asshole to think it was ok to drag people into the darkness in my life and expect them to magically get me out. I guess I was thinking who else do I have to turn to? This was a major mistake because I lost all of my friends as they stopped talking to me and to this day have moved on while I feel I haven’t. 

During college I tried to reinvent myself. Once again, I was outgoing, nice and friendly. I met a lot of people and had a fling or two with someone else. Though, deep down inside I felt as if I was out of place. Attending college in a new state was challenging and towards this time I started to look into moving back to my hometown. 

Post college was a strange time for me. I realize now that I might have had a mental break down and started using social media in an extremely unhealthy way. Posting too much and sometimes getting very personal but more importantly looking at people I knew in high school and becoming incredibly jealous at their life, jobs and relationships. In retrospect I had so much of a support base even then and failed to take advantage of it. I got a job in my career and moved back to VA but I felt alone in that state and desired to come back to the NYC area. Fast forward to now. I moved back in to my Mother’s house 3 years after college. 

Things are at an all time low in my life. I cannot find a job in my career which is causing me to become intensely depressed. I have developed a bad habit of staying in my room or in bed most of the time after work. I work at a warehouse and feel as though I’m slipping future away from my career. I also don’t date and have no friends. I have become quite skinny since college as a result of my hermit lifestyle. Despite this I keep my head up. I keep telling myself that the worst has happened and that good things can come if I work for it. I tell myself that I’ve thought about suicide so much that it’s a very real possibility and I would be better off riding it out and reinventing myself. I want to go to the gym this year and rebuild myself, meet new friends, move out and find a job in my career. Though, it feels like I’m stuck in a rut of job rejections I can’t get out of which makes me feel awful. I have a lot of love in me and don’t want to let go yet. I know I’ve made mistakes in my life time but I know I’m working hard to getting my feet back on the ground so I can live a halfway decent life. I am currently getting back into my career of filmmaking and working on a screenplay that tries to capture so my thoughts on struggles in my youth along with depression and suicidal thoughts. It has been a way to cope with being a loner and living at home as an adult. Though I see some of the steps I need to take to change things around and find some peace with my life.

Do people react more to losing someone by suicide?,"People grieve those who die. I guess when people kill themselves, others react with anger and confusion along with sadness. And there isn’t really a period of terminal illness, so people can’t prepare. But death is death. Wouldn’t a parent react in roughly the same way if their child died in a car accident? I think so, except for the whole “we could have done something to stop it” thing. It’s weird to me how people view death by suicide so differently.

I’m done with people who give useless advice,"Hey folks it’s me

I’ve never posted here before but I thought what the hell let’s see 

Ok bit of backstory depression anxiety and abandonment issues with some divorced parents and extreme mental health problems in my genetics.

I’ve been trying to kill myself since the 4th grade I always try around the same time after thanks giving before Christmas. Obviously I’ve failed every time whether I wasn’t brave enough or hoodie strings aren’t super sturdy. My family has a big problem with standing out whether it be mental health or homosexuality guess what I’m both. 

I told my mother that I’ve thought about and tried killing myself since 4th grade. She said we’d go see someone but we never did. My dad used to be my hero sadly I’ve grown up a bit and now I realize he’s a lazy drug addict who can’t even keep the promise of eating dinner with me. On the other hand my mother has extremely severe OCD not like did I leave the curling iron on more like spending an hour moving every pine cone off the side walk every day causing me to be late to school.

A friend is thinking about suicide,"Hi Reddit, I believe I have a serious problem in hand right now. A friend of mine is going through a period of deep stress, induced by university exams, relationship problems. She's a foreign student so reliance on her family is quite restricted due to geographical distance. Through her words I have learned that the thought of commiting suicide did cross her mind some odd times before this happened. Recently, sometimes she just breaks down and cries just because of trivial incidents. She tried to cut herself(this also have happened before), saying she's had enough of everything, that she doesn't want to try anymore. I suggested visiting  a psychotherapist, but she flat out refused, saying she's fine. What do I do now? We live in Germany. Thanks for your help?

Holidays are rough,"I've have a lot of ups and downs lately. I've been trying really hard but I've been ready to go now for a long while. My pact partner has been the one holding me up for some time now. I try my very best to not beg or bother them but I'm not well.

I feel like what little family support I thought I had has been pulled out from under my feet. My sisters family as well as little brothers came into town for Christmas. I visited them twice briefly before Christmas by heading to my parents and trying to coordinate such that my rapist wasn't there while i was or at least that i could make a hasty retreat if they showed up. Well, the little time I spent with my family was shallow and not really connecting with them in the least.

A few weeks ago, I wrote my Mom a letter. One where I tried to air my grivances about my parents loss of respect for me bring transgender. I'm supposedly luckier than others because they do love me for sure but I've come to understand and stop defending the fact that they do not respect me or the things I've had to do in order to survive and thrive. My mom has this letter then which is a jumbled mess of emotions but does try to ask for a few things i really need like to use my actual name now rather than a cutesy nickname they use to avoid my chosen name. She refuses to read it though. Its been 4 weeks now and all she'll tell me is that i have to give her time. They still love me a lot but they can't see me for who I truly am and they refuse to listen to me.

So while I've not been disowned or suffered violence at their hands like other people in my situation, they don't respect me or care enough about me to listen to anything I have to say. This is only the newest reason in a huge pile of ones that urge me to leave. I've been trying so very hard to keep at it all but some things just don't change and are a part of my history.

How do we know suicide is bad?,"I’ve been wondering but still haven’t found an answer... How people know killing themselves is bad? How do they know whether it’s not actually a redemption and perhaps something after this life is much more worth it and better and this life is just a prison that’s keeping us from the real happiness? Well, I know there are religions that each tell something about it, but plenty of people are actually atheists, how do these people know it’s bad? Also, as people we have a survival instinct that makes suicide much harder than ever. How do we know whether it’s not an actual trap that’s keeping us away from experiencing greater happiness?

Suicidal confliction,"Hey guys, so I don’t know if I’m posting this in the wrong place, it is my first time using this subreddit. 

I just thought I’d voice my thoughts as I have nowhere else. Basic back story, I’m 24 years old, recently found out that I’m not quite the gender I was born (long story and this doesn’t have much to do with it, although it’s an added stressor). I’ve also been incredibly depressed for the last 6 years or so, with my last suicidal episode happening around that time too. 

Anyway, long story short, I was planning on ending it tonight, but my ex who I loved dearly and broke up with recently came over and we had sex. But I don’t feel better from it. I feel like she did that as blackmail so that I wouldn’t end it all. What do you guys think? 

I mean I know she means well, but it’s extremely painful to be manipulated in that way. Also since I have an issue with my sexuality being such.

I told my Parents that soon I am going to kill myself,"Hey guys,

Im 18 years old now and I have depressions since I was 13. My familiy is religious and very since I was born I was taught to read the koran, do religios stuff etc. But one day I quit it because I dont see any sense in God. Anyways, I know that they would never accept this (me being unreligious) but my sister knew it so many years ago. She kept it a secret but always tries to tell my parents that Im unreligious but they wont believe her and think that she is just joking.

ANYWAYS, Im pretty sure that the fight they've kept (my parents) is a huge factor of my depressions. 

Also, I am a very emotional person and I've been in this typical I love her, she doesnt love me drama but I accept it. 

Actually Im quite happy that she has a boyfriend and they've been together for over 2 years now. He is obviously able to make her happy, so I really do appreciate theyr relationship! But I must admit it hurts me for such a long time.

Also my grades are not the best. I always try to keep up, learn as much as I can but I dont get the good ones. Other people tell me they dont even learn but still get better grades than I do.

I know its no solution  and I **will** make people sad but the only thing that held be back from finishing my life are my parents. But today I had the courage to tell them. I told them that soon I might kill myself. I never had such a feeling before but my face was forcing me to look sad. I could **not** control my face anymore. It literally made itself look sad in the moment when I told them how much I love them but still going to killmyself because of them. 

Also I've been beaten by my mother a few times when I was younger but I see no bad in that. If I look at my current generation Im glad that my mother raised me that way.

I know this subreddit is not really made to state that I am depressive but I really had to say this to someone.

Theres some part of me that doesnt want to give up but that gets crushed a little more everyday. I'm very close to the breaking point. At least at the end my thoughts will be known. I've done video blogs to document my declining mental state and my profound sadness. I'm writing letters. No one will need an explanation, they all know I'm suffering they just choose to remain unaware. The blog may give some comfort to those that blame themselves.

2018 in review,"Both the best year I've experienced, but also the worst.

2018 started at the end of a winter trip with the most wonderful person in the world. I've been with this woman for five years, and while we've had our ups and downs, we've been closer than anyone else and made for an incredibly tight team. But the year also began with the suicide of her school friend, and this hit her hard. They fought, back in 2016, and now there would never be a chance to rekindle their friendship. She fell into a deep depression that February, and would lapse back in throughout the year.

Summer was great. We live across an ocean from each other, and for the past three years only saw each other for a few weeks at a time. This time, mega trip, 3 whole months living with her. She loved my cooking, I'd help her with her work, we'd take shopping trips out and spent her holiday roaming the coast. We had a lot of fun, and even when the relationship dissolved partway through, we were close enough friends that she cried when I had to leave. Asked me not to be sad, we'll see each other again I promise, and through the autumn we made plans for another winter trip and getting a house together.

But autumn is also when depression tightened its grip around her neck. Suicidal ideation came back, after not having to worry for so long. It was hard on me to see her suffer so much, with nothing I could do over discord. But with each passing day, we'd be a little closer to the trip. A little patience, and I could make things a little easier for her, give her good food, a friend to come home to and relax with, take her assignments off her hand.

Two weeks before the trip, ""I figured out what's been going on,"" but she didn't say what. Don't come here, no more of this, blocked. Overnight, we're talking about getting a car and insurance, getting me drunk and getting mixed drink recipes from an uncle. Next evening, this. Sudden, no warning or explanation. The only foreshadowing event being the reappearance of an old friend from a mouse game, who had been acting manic around this time, spreading rumours, pestering others.

But two hard weeks went by. I found it in me to finish my semester and graduate, magna cum laude. I had hoped at first that this might've been pre-trip anxiety, as sometimes happens, but zero word back from her in this time. The 45 day winter trip turned into one week: I learned, via a beautiful art update on instagram, that she felt herself to be a victim of abuse, and had freed herself from such. Which doesn't make sense, without the context of mentally ill friend's predatory rumours. 

But a hard fact had to be accepted: this is her belief now, her reality. For all the adventures and promises and mutual support, her belief is that our relationship was one of abuse. I've never given her worse than a spanking without her permission, been accepting of her life choices, and the most we did when drunk was make goofy videos and see who could walk down the hall the straightest, so I know for a fact that I've never abused her. But if she believes I have, that needs to be respected, because those wounds are real to her and need healing.

I booked my flight out, and left her behind without ever seeing her, without ever fixing the problem.

Each day has been harder than the last. I dream of her, of talking to her, of having another adventure with her, of her disappointment, in being cut out from her. I wake up empty, alone, ready to cry from the moment I wake up, and do throughout the day. My eyes are 8000 miles away. And when I look out the window, at the concrete fall below, I'm tempted. I'm so very tempted. My best friend, my closest friend, ripped away suddenly. I have to live with the knowledge that I've become a hated thing, by the person who means the most to me. I have to live knowing that she still aches for her friend and suffers. I don't want to wake up one morning to her sister telling me that she's taken her own life.

For those reasons, the desire to end my life has been stronger than ever.

The only reason that I haven't is because it'd for sure mean that we'd never see each other again. A 99.999% chance versus 100%. And she still makes her art, so I can still support her through it. Her art is her passion, it gives her life, and sometimes it carries her heart. I can never again be her confidant, but I know how sweet and brilliant she is: she will try to find friends and loves to fill my absence, and she is such a remarkable person that I know that she will easily find like-minded friends. I can never again have a place in her life, but my hope is that hers is long, happy, fulfilled, one where she is free.

That is the only thread that ties me to this Earth, now.

I feel it's the time to leave this world.,"As I'm writing this, I don't have any negative emotion (Or at least not any unusual negative emotion.)

I really don't know what to say, I just feel just like any animal who knows it's time is coming soon and wants bid a farewell to everyone.

Unfortunately for me there isn't anyone worth noting to say my farewells.

The thing with me is that I'm too chicken to even attempt a suicide attempt.I even was too chicken to even talk to the girl I fell in love in elementary and when I finally found the courage, she was already married with two children and now she is going for the third.

Actually let me take it back, I might have done a suicide attempt as I wasn't aware of this at the time since, I was in a tantrum, and punched the glass door of my house which left my left arm partially crippled.

I guess it's just luck, some people have their way and some don't so depression starts to sink in over the years to the point where they don't have anything left to fight for.

When I kept texting her after finishing school because, I didn't really wanna bother her middle section since she was the best student and I didn't want to upset her family by going on secret dates, thus neglecting her studies, because back then she seemed to have interest in me, I guess because I was ripped, so that I have confidence to talk to her, which I never managed to do because the chances where I didn't have any stress which was making my face ugly were very few, and I had to convince myself that nothing with ever happen between us, so that I won't be ugly if I went to talk to her.There really weren't many of those chances and I missed them all.Something was always preventing me from being able to just talk to her.

When we finished school I started searching in facebook in order to find her and when I finally did, I realized I wasn't able to send her messages, but only friend requests which she declined.

I started talking to a friend of hers and begged her to tell her to open up the messages so I can talk to her, since I had no other way to talk to her besides going straight to her house, which when I did, it ended up with her mother taking over the conversation between us and started screaming repeatedly never to hit the ringbell again, I still don't know why she was in that amok, the only thing I said was that I was an old schoolmate and her mother acted as if I was going to slaughter them in cold blood with a machete... lol.

Anyway it doesn't matter now, it's too late, to even be able to take advantage to a connection in order to talk to her.

In the meantime most of the acquaintances treat me like I'm already gone, they have this mourning face when they see me, as if they remembered someone who is no longer alive.

I guess the only thing I managed to convince everyone was how creepy I was since they have a clingy face when they see me.

But the thing is that even I find this story lame, If someone else told me a similar story, I would be like""Chill out breh, there are lots of women out there"" but unfortunately this pathetic guy is me, and the only way to shut him of is to block him emotionally cause he is retarded.He just can't get past the simple reality that he had his chance and he wasted it.I started learning c++, Unity, Maya and Unreal in order to make a living out of making software, but the emotions get in the way and ruin everything due to tantrums which leave me unable to cooperate with anyone.

I started exercising again in order to leave that woman behind me and find new ones, until I dislocated my shoulder and now I'm pretty much useless as usual.

I really don't know why I posted this, I just hoped that it would trigger some emotional reaction so I can slit my wrists in the bathroom, just like the cool kids do nowadays.But I typed all this shit and I have nothing to show for it and it would be a huge waste if I didn't post it, but it's a waste either way because if I wouldn't care for a person who wants to die because of unfulfilled love, then why anyone would?

I have much greater chance to die from hunger and dehydration in my room than from suicide, since in order for someone to coming suicide it takes some balls to do that.",Negative1821,6,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aame05/i_feel_its_the_time_to_leave_this_world/,12/29/2018/16:13:07,aame05,SuicideWatch

I did something wrong.,"Hi.

I'm using a throwaway right now to prevent friends from worrying about me.

No matter what I do, it's always something wrong. Every single time, it's something completely fucking wrong.

I'm 15 and have a multitude of underlying issues. Among them is autism, ptsd, severe depression and anxiety and constant suicidal thoughts. My therapist is even beginning to think I've developed BPD from the trauma I've faced. 

No matter what I do, it's always something wrong. 

I suffered abuse of varying types and severities from multiple people when I was a kid, and overtime built up into expecting to get hit or screamed at whenever I did something wrong. I suffer from nightmares daily and only half the time I wake up in tears from them.

I fell into Depressive Suicidal Black Metal to match my thoughts, but found that it only makes my suicidal ideation worse. But it makes me feel alive and at home. At ease.

Every moment of my waking life is spent thinking about how death could be and having panic attacks over thinking about the nothingness that follows.

Nothing is worth it anymore. I spend most of my days sleeping and crying and cutting as deep as I can anyways. I wish I could hang myself or open an artery in my arm or neck or something, but I can't. Despite my desire to feel pain, I've felt far too much of it to handle it.

I'm a pain in the ass to everyone who says they love me. I'm so afraid of abandonment that I push people away before they have the chance to abandon me. I constantly want to shoot myself. Even right now, with my significant other laying next to me, I want to grab a rifle from my stepdad's gun cabinet and lodge a bullet into my skull. Nothing I do is good enough.

Even with people around me, I feel alone.
Abandoned.
Frightened.
Fucking horrible.
Shitty.
Self-centered.
Attention whoreish.

I want kill myself on New Years Eve but I can't. I want it to end, but it can't. I want everything to stop and I just want to fade into a cold black nothingness, but it won't.

I'll suffer until I find the balls to fucking shoot myself.",SuicidalEuphoria,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aakose/i_did_something_wrong/,12/29/2018/11:58:19,aakose,SuicideWatch

Just need to get some feelings out,"I'm not looking for a friend. I'm not in the right mental space to be that kind of person for someone. 

I just need to vent to about all these feelings because I don't have anyone to turn to. I can't even seem to tell my fucking therapist. I'm so incompetent when it comes to opening up emotionally, in person at least. 

I am in so much pain. Everyday I feel worse. I haven't had a good day in so long. I got so close to killing myself the other day. I held the pills in my hand for what felt like forever. Eventually I'm not going to be able to put them down. 

When I told my therapist about my suicidal ideation I reassured him that I don't want to. But what I meant is I don't want to hurt my family. I want to kill myself so bad though. It's taking everything in me not to right now. 

I've been making myself throw up a lot lately. I'm supposed to be getting better but I don't have the energy or motivation to continue any longer. The throwing up can kill me if I do it enough. I might just take the pills.

Not Me,"I met a kid in school. His name was Dylan. He was pretty cool I mean he was into games and most specifically Smash Bros. We were both really good and after playing against each other in Super Smash Flash in the library, we became friends. 2 years past and he's gotten down. He isn't into Smash anymore and i feel like he doesn't have a personality anymore. I don't know if something happened with him and his family. I don't know if he actually attempted suicide. He DM'd me (idk if that's right) on discord one day confessing that he wanted to die. He said he doesn't want to live because of his parents and life. He doesn't want to do anything, he's always depressed, and he only really likes to 'cube'. I asked him what that meant and it is actually really cool. You are supposed to solve the Rubik's Cube as fast as you can. Anyways, I don't know what to do. He said he grabbed a knife from the kitchen put it up to his throat and broke down before he could ""Do It"". He's a really good friend and he doesn't want anyone to know. Now i'm in the most awkward place because I love him as a brother and i wouldn't do anything mean to him. But I fear that one day he's gonna snap. He could shoot up the school, or commit suicide in the bathrooms. You're probably thinking that saying ""In the Bathrooms"" is a little specific. That's because of ANOTHER kid. I have another friend, Landon, who is pretty cool. Landon had a discord server where he invited all of us. He invited his friend, Cole. I didn't know who he was until we actually started talking. We became friends and he said he was a grade above me. He was pretty cool. One day he was feeling weird. In his words, he referred to suicide like it was the holy grail. It was pretty fucked. He knew about Dylan, which idk what im gonna do about, and started open-mindedly talking about it. He said he loved the feeling of metal cutting deep into his skin. He was addicted to cutting. It was creepy to me. But then he started talking about his past. He said in 8th grade, he hung himself in the stalls because he was done with life. Until one kid came in and busted down the door and cut the noose. It was creepily interesting. The fact that he wanted to do that but, all the planning that went into that. Altogether, I need help with Dylan and Cole. They are both suicidal and i don't know what to do. Any help is appreciated.

"I fucking can’t live, I have no future, no skills, nothing!","I can’t see myself doing anything after college. I’m majoring in political science because I saw a 90k average salary on BLS, but every job I see if a fucking joke, a bullshit salary, or next to impossible to get into.

I just sat with a gun to my head for half an hour.,"Obviously I’m still here typing this but about an hour ago a had a loaded gun to my head, ready to go. Idk why I didn’t pull the trigger, but if my life keeps going the way it is then I don’t know if I’ll keep going.  Sorry if this isn’t the place for it, but I figured I’d put this out there, even if no one will find it.

My family is a fucking mess. One second, my dad is all fun and games, buys me a car and tells me how proud he is, and the next he’s screaming about how I’m a piece of shit and worthless.  My mom has never cared about me and though she won’t admit it, she wishes I hadn’t been born. She will do anything for my sister, but absolutely hates me despite how much more responsible I’ve always been. My sister has bullied and abused me since before I can remember. She got addicted to drugs two years ago, went to rehab, and now she’s “changed” and I’m expected to pretend that she hadn’t bullied me for the last 18 years and forgive her.

I’m starting to realize that my “friends aren’t really my friends after all. The love to come to my expensive house, play my expensive games, and eat my expensive food, but as soon as you ask them to do something for you they ignore you and do something else. I’m not talking about big favors, I’m talking like “hey can you pass me that drink next to you?”.  They will argue about every rule I put in front of them in my house or car.  Again, nothing out of the ordinary, just “put your cap on your Gatorade when you’re not drinking it so it doesn’t spill on the carpet”. It’s like hanging out with a bunch of spoiled 8 year olds.

Apart from that I’m already a year behind in college because I can’t pass physics. I feel like every major out there would be miserable but the one I’m in, but I can’t fucking pass the required classes. I feel like a retard in college and my mom makes sure I feel the same at home.  The only thing I really care about is my 19 year old dog. She’s about to die and when she does, I might go with her.

I’ve been self medicating with video games, Reddit, and alcohol for a few years, but I’ve grown to hate those too.  I get angry at games, I hate the reddit hive mind culture, and drinking makes me sick now. I’m done.  I hung out with my “friends” all day today and I’ve never felt more alone.  When I got home I grabbed my pistol from my safe and sat on my bathroom floor for half an hour trying to gather up the guys to pull the trigger, but I guess I’m to stupid to do that too.",throwaway19475920374,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aai7u9/i_just_sat_with_a_gun_to_my_head_for_half_an_hour/,12/29/2018/04:59:13,aai7u9,SuicideWatch
Just need someone to listen,"**EDIT: This is a RANT.** 

I hate myself, and everyone around me. I'm depressed and I know it. I think my friends know it as well but never mentioned to me about it because who would want to carry that burden and it'd be really awkward, or they just don't know. Other than that, no one knows, including my parents. And it frustrates me. But this post is probably going to frustrate you too (because you'll realize that I exaggerate things and it's not as bad as you thought), so take a seat, grab some tea, if you're willing to read it all. I apologize in advance.

I don't know where to start. All my life my mom has basically told me to get good marks. And it's really tiring to try that hard all the time, to get straight A's, especially on things that don't matter. And if I don't, I'm a let down etc. My brother on the other hand gets 60s (or lower) and 70s if he's lucky. My parents say I should be lucky to be smart like I am but I disagree. My brother is so carefree and plays games literally every second of his life if he's not at school. If I get caught on my phone from watching a few videos, my mom (forgot the word) rants about how I'm ""addicted"" to my phone. My mom complains about me all the time. If I don't do the dishes, that's something to complain about, etc. And I don't say anything back but she works really hard and she's basically the backbone of the family so she's under a lot of stress all the time. But in my mind I get sick and tired. My parents tell me to do a lot more things than my brother does, and if I say something about it, I get told, ""stop complaining, we raised you since you were young and this is how you repay us?"" or, ""because you a girl and that's what girls do."" And that's such a crappy answer because my brother doesn't even do the yard work or ""what boys do."" But guess I complain too much :c. I'll be touching on this later too. Because of this I have these outbursts where I want to die and I yell at my parents and argue. Lately it's becoming more frequent. Sometimes my mom calls me a devil, demon, devil's child etc., she also says that I'm killing her and stuff. It really hurts because everything I do wrong is weighed a lot more heavier than what I do right. I don't remember any happy memories and only remember the bad ones. I can't remember memories from 1-11 or I have fragments of those years. I have a horrible sense of time so something that happened a few days ago I think happened a few months ago or something like that. I'm a contraception of everyone's expectations. I'm stressed and I want to die. My parents, I am a straight A student, my friends I'm a shy yet social person, I'm negative yet positive, realistic yet submerged in my own fantasies. If I didn't have anyone around me, I would be a shell of a person. I try so hard to be perfect even when I know it doesn't exist and I beat myself up for it. There are countless nights I've reflected and all those memories haunt back to me, all my mistakes that remind me that I'm not perfect. I'm crying as I write this because I realize how broken I am. I'm not smart. My mistakes stand out 100x more than what I do right. I'm a sensitive brat. I take criticism way more personally than I should. This whole thread is just me complaining. I hate living. I cry myself to sleep some days and hope I never wake up but every day I do. It pains for me to live, but it'd pain others if I'd die. But that's just my personal life, let's start talking about my school life.

I think my friends think I'm a spoiled brat. I think I convinced myself that I have a low self-esteem but I just have a high ego. I don't apologize often-actually yes I do. But I'm extremely petty. I jump to conclusions too often. I hold grudges way too often and other people's opinions affect me a lot. I'm not spoiled. I worked hard to get what I have. I compare a lot too, let me show you how. My brother, who like I said before sucks at school, gets a new laptop by doing nothing why I have to work my butt off to get good marks to get a laptop. It sucks. Why do I have to work hard when he doesn't? Why do I have go through those nights of no sleep but he doesn't? I know the world is unfair. I'm not fit to be in this world. I'm sorry that I'm ranting again, just need to get this off my chest. I had to research what laptop I would like, the specs and everything. My brother didn't do anything. I had to do that for him. I'm angry. I know that's selfish, and I should be grateful that my parents could even afford a laptop. But I can't help it. If I don't do it, my mom says, I can't even do this little thing for her, that I'm selfish. My brother can't even search something up on google. Anything tech related goes through me because my brother can't google it or ""doesn't know how."" He ""doesn't know how"" to wash the dishes even. I want to be ignorant like him. Because his life is happy (well, he also receives a fair share of yelling etc.). Mine is not. I bet my friends think I got the laptop because I'm spoiled, that I live in a big house etc. But that's not true. I know it isn't. But I ask myself why do I have to prove it to them? Why do I conclude that my friends think that? Why do I think of the worse all the time? I drop many hints to my friends that I need someone to talk to but they don't pick it up. I make jokes about my depression because it makes me feel like my life is a joke.

I think most of this is actually personal/family life, so I'll go back to that. I know I talk like my mom is the worse, but keep in mind I'm really sensitive and I tend to over blow things so maybe that's why I'm depressed.  My mom provides me with my physical needs but not my mental needs. She's busy all the time. My two brothers (one older one younger) are a pain. My parents say I'm too mean to both of them. But they irritate me. Both of them are stupid and it's irritating. My baby brother ruins my things and I have to clean it up. When I yell at him my parents remind me that I was much worse when I was little har har har. But I can smell it, my baby brother is becoming a spoiled brat before my eyes, and they are doing nothing to stop it. Whatever, it's not my problem anymore. (But how could I not be annoyed?) I'm afraid of physical pain, well a lot of people are. So I'll be more specific. I'm afraid of contact-sports. Basketballs, soccerballs I'm really afraid of them. Not sure if it's a traumatic experience but I freeze up when I hear the bouncing sound of a basketball. I ""sense"" the danger and it gets worse when that sound gets louder. I'm a mess. I'm afraid of the dark but love it at the same time. I want to die but I want to live. I shouldn't be complaining. Other people have a lot worse than me. I should be grateful, but I'm not. I have a good life, but I want to die. My parents argue too much, they yell a lot. I'm in my room all day because of that, but it doesn't help. I still hear it. I still hear when they yell. My mom said a few days ago (?) during one of my outbursts, ""Have you ever seen another child that acts like that towards their parents?"" My brother said, ""Only in movies."" I wanted to say, ""I wish my life were a movie because it'd end."" I also want to say that I yell because they yell. My mom says ""I can't yell because it's rude, I can't swear because it's not ladylike."" But she does it. All the time. She doesn't think about my mental state, I think it's obvious that children take on their parents, and if that's the behavior they show me, it will rub on me eventually. Also, like I said, I'm in my room all day. My mom says I should come down more often, I come down and my brother tells me to go back upstairs because I yell too much. I want to say nasty things. It's hypocritical. You can't have both, choose one. Last thing, my mom says that I should go into IB, but I don't want to. She says it's my decision but I know it's not. I said I don't want to do it and she says ""what about my future?"" or whatever. I'm in gifted at the moment, it ends in grade 10 and she ""doesn't like the idea of me going into mainstream."" Because I'll become stupid like them. I just want to let her know, that I may not have a future. She makes excuses on my excuses on why I don't want to go into IB. There isn't a choice. I plan for my future, thinking I will have a good life, but I realize that if I keep thinking about the future, my present will slip away. I don't think I will have a future. I know this post is all over the place, I'm having one of my outbursts again and I just need to let it out. I don't want to live anymore. I've thought about it. And there isn't a point to live. I've told other people, ""the meaning of life is for you to define it."" But I can't even follow that myself. I'm a hypocrite.

There isn't a point to live. I hate living. I have people who are living. I hate people. We destroy the environment too much, there's so many problems caused by us. I know why people say ignorance is a bliss. I see people in the comment section say that if one thinks there are so many problems caused by humans, why don't they just die? So it'd be one less human to cause pain to the world. I agree. I want to start off that chain. I know it's selfish for me to die. They say it's selfish for people to leave their loved ones behind. But it also works the other way around because they're selfish for keeping me alive just so they don't feel pain. They say suicide is cowardly too, but I think it's pretty brave to murder yourself. I've been fighting for a long time now, and in a week's worth of time I'd probably forget about this. Thinking my life is so happy, then having these outbursts that say otherwise. I can't remember when I started feeling like this, probably in grade 4... I can't get help because I just don't like sharing feelings to people in real life. I like the idea of me behind a computer screen, anonymous. If you're still reading I'd like to thank you for reading this. I just need someone to know how I'm feeling. I know that I'm not alone, with my depression and stuff, but I feel alone. It's cold. I've had this throat pain for a while now, maybe this is a thyroid issue, I've heard that can cause depression. I dunno. I'm tired, I want to sleep forever. Thanks guys for reading, it makes me feel a bit better that someone read it, that someone understands.

I’ve decided,"I’ve decided the day I’m going to kill myself if things don’t get better. I’ve always had an inkling but today I snapped and put a timer in my phone. Maybe I’ll forget and this will be a fleeting memory, but I’ve been up this creek so many times that I’ve come numb to the idea of taking my own life. Recently I saw a video about someone who had survived his attempt, and he said “I’d never thought of suicide before.” It made me wonder, there are just some lucky people out there who couldn’t even fathom the thought. I envy them. Wish I could be like them. Wish I could change and be better, but I’m too stubborn and I’ve lived my life as an evil person this long, I don’t think I’d be able to recognize myself if I actually started to show I care. Deep down I do, but I can’t show it, because if I lose someone else I don’t know what I’ll do.

Fuck life. Fuck depression. Fuck me.,"I see a therapist and a psychiatrist, but I inevitably end right back in the same position. I don't get the point anymore. We are all going to die one day. Why would I want to live a miserable long existence before I do? My sessions with my therapist feel good and help in that moment, but when I leave I don't know what the fuck to do with myself. My therapist is not there when I need him the most. I can't contact him when I am at my lowest of lows wanting to die. Can anyone even hear me??? I AM DYING INSIDE.

Lost and looking for something,"TL:DR  
Childhood abuse paved way for messy future, stuck hopelessly floating the stormy sea of ""fml""

&#x200B;

Over the years (Currently 25) I've been dealing with severe childhood trauma. To the point where I suppressed memories and felt like I was in a ghost shell. I couldn't really memorize things, math/science/schooling was difficult due to that. My family just assumed I was the dope out of my three siblings. I was never given much attention in regards to falling behind..I used to harm myself, and so far I've avoided those habits. Even old ways of venting seem useless. I even lost joy in being mean to myself.

After my grandfather passed away the summer before my 24th birthday.. Huge chunks of my childhood started flooding back. I still have nightmares about it. The more I remember the more crazy and messed up I feel.

I DO love myself, it's still hard for me to rationalize how and why this happened to me.

I feel like a burden to the few friends and family I can talk to about this..I know people say therapy helps, but I'm terrified of telling all of this to anyone. It's getting to the point where I feel  like I'm living a lie, because I don't feel like people even know who I am, or what I'm going through daily.

I've reached out to loved ones before, when I've been at my worst and thought I had schizophrenia-my family mostly treated me like I didn't know what I was talking about. Disregarded my request for help..Later my dad pulled me aside and said if I was serious, he'd help me..That was nice, but all in all, It was discouraging. 

I'm at a point where I've felt suicidal for the majority of my life, even before I learned what the word meant.. I'm tired. Exhausted. Life is losing luster. My relationship has been unhealthy with my boyfriend for a time now, I'm desperately trying to mend or repair the few things in my life that I CAN control. I know suicide is something a lot of people feel is selfish but, if my quality of life is this miserable why would someone blame me?

Am I supposed to endure suffering, continuously, so others around me don't feel inconvenienced by my death?

Idk man, it's a big cluster mess. I need help, I don't know who to turn to anymore or what else to do. Nothing seems to work. I don't want to keep going alone, but idk who out there is willing to seriously help me. If I keep getting moved aside or if people keep giving up on me.. I fear I'll give in. I want to love life, I want to feel the shine people say I bring them.. If I'm a lighthouse where's my warmth going? If not to me? 

Again, anything anyone thinks might be useful-would be great. Sorry for the mess of words. I don't know what to say really.",throwawayshame55,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aahpcq/lost_and_looking_for_something/,12/29/2018/03:50:20,aahpcq,SuicideWatch
Does anyone else ever feel that strange split-personality feeling that everyone describes suicide victims as post-mortem?,"Yikes, a morbid title. But it's on my mind, so hey.

Anyway, you guys know all those pictures of Kurt Cobain eating pizza and wearing silly sunglasses, and everyone says ""Wow, he looked so happy! Hard to believe he killed himself?""

I'm only curious because I do feel happy. Genuine happiness - I think, but I can't be sure.

It's just it's always weighted by... y'know, those feelings. 

I love driving at night. I've had my car since I was a youngern, and there are few things I enjoy as much as screaming at the top of my lungs on a midnight drive through the country. Fills me with life. Makes me feel young, for a minute at least.

But even then, even in my happiest, most private moments I still know it's coming. I still know that I might not wake up tomorrow feeling shitty, or the day after... but it's gonna happen. Eventually it'll all come rolling back. 

I try not to let it get to me when I'm happy. I've lost most of my close friends (thanks, alcohol abuse. Appreciate it a bunch) but when I'm with someone I consider close, I always feel like half my energy is spent just being happy - just letting myself enjoy those moments and not get caught up in the future. It's so fucking hard being happy. To surrender to a moment. Maybe I don't have issues with embracing happiness because I've never really felt those feelings.

The sun shines, every single day. But I'm just so goddamned terrified of it setting that I'm never ready to open the blinds, it feels.",explodyboompow,5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aahlvi/does_anyone_else_ever_feel_that_strange/,12/29/2018/03:37:46,aahlvi,SuicideWatch

TL;DR Best friends with both a guy and his brother, brother stabs me in the back for a girl (who I believe manipulated him into doing it), guy stuck between rock and a hard place as its his bro vs best friend, I have feelings that friendship has suffered due to being unable to confide or fact he's never defended me due to it being about his brother, point where he's started slightly defending the girl. Feel so alone, suicidal thoughts - Wat do.

____

My two best mates were a guy named Ant and his brother Craig.

Ant known the longest (18+ years best friends), but more in common personality wise with Craig. Super close, younger and friends since he was little, like a brother (12+ years)

Housemates with Ant, saw Craig every 1-2 weeks hanging out.

Craig gets serious girlfriend, over period of 1.5 years hangs out less and less (I express concern to him, ignored)

Gf encourages him to hang out with her brothers more and more, starts drinking w them on a bi-daily basis. Also starts to change his fashion and clothes to what she likes him to wear.

Tells me and Ant he's proposed to her, and asks me and Ant to be best men for their wedding, honoured. We offer to help with anything that needs doing.

Closer to wedding, suit shop once or twice but thats it in terms of contributing. His gf wants us me and Ant to buy matching suits, on our own dime (and ones she picked). Luckily have similar colour, so agree can use that instead of buying new.

Discuss stag ideas with Ant, make a plan.

His fiance decides she wants him to have drinks with her brothers for his stag instead of whatever our plan is, and he agrees to do that.

We find out, Ant doesn't say anything, I do - Unhappy, but suggest either go out together, or have two stags. Decides no stag.

Manage to arrange mini stag anyway in terms of paintballing with everyone, good time is had by all.

Wedding day - Me and Ant in matching suits. Stay in wedding hotel (own dime). Ceremony, in front row with Ant. Ant gives ring, I sit there and watch.

Sit down in allocated seats - Ants at head table, I'm assigned random seat with masses. Craig then gives speech and thanks.... I'm not mentioned once, or even refered to as ""Best Man"" - Ant is. Meanwhile several people never heard of are given mentions and thanks.

Turns out, without telling me, and although I'm there wearing a matching bloody suit (like if me and Ant were a couple, in hindsight), he had no longer made me a best man. No explaination, no reasoning, no care given. Still hasn't told me to this day. My parents were there, everyone was there - Felt like an utter twat.

Best and close friend of many years effectively betrayed me. Insanely upset, as only have a small amount of close friends and treated him as my on brother, and thought he felt the same. Also turns out that Craig's other best friend wasn't even invited to the wedding until the last minute (he has no idea why himself)

Following wedding, they then went on a holiday a few weeks later (which happened to be during my birthday, no card or message), and not a word. The only person I can vent to or discuss this with is Ant... and its his brother. Lack of being able to confide in Ants starts to feel like our friendship is weaker, and he's too scared to say anything to Craig about all this (he hates conflict).

At which point I decided to cut off contact. I've cut off contact now for 1 year 2 months (missing my 30th birthday party). Not a word from Craig, and to this day it still upsets me. I blame him, and I blame his now wife. He is in control of his own actions, however I used to be a massive manipulator when I was younger. I know manipulation when I see it, and think she got him wrapped around her little finger. He was depressed, wanted a family and someone to love - She wanted someone to do what she wants and control.

I've tried to speak to Ants about this and share how I feel, but he doesn't know what to do/say (naturally) - But he's now started defending her on the rare occassion I bring it up, as as a couple they invite him round, or take him out for meals, etc... - Its getting to the point where as much as I love Ants, and do so much for him, he'll never defend me. He'll never talk to Craig or tell him off for what he did, he'll just ignore/bury it, and let me suffer.

I'm just at point now where I don't know how I'm going to get over this combination. Suicide is dramatic, however the thoughts still linger in moments like this, when I've spent far too long typing a scenario no-one will probably read... and I don't blame them, its awfully wordy!

Its been 1 yr and 2 months now, and they are still together - Any manipulation she may have done and been exposed for is naturally going to go with the passage of time and living together for so long making you 'used' to each other, meaning it is how it is. However the fact that this is the case, after being betrayed, without a care in the world for me.... hurts.

(Rant) Just about tired!,"I’m just about tired of people telling me that I should get help for wanting to constantly commit suicide. About a year and a half ago, I saw a site that showed you the pain levels of certain suicide methods, and how long it takes to kill your self with said method. That page had long been since removed from google search, but when I try to find the page again, all I’m given, is 

“PLEASE DIAL 1-800-273-8255 IF YOU FEEL SUICIDAL!”

“DONT KILL URSELF GARBLABLABLABLA! There is hope!”

“Go Call the suicide hotline!!!!!1!!!!”

For the record, you don’t know me, you don’t know that I can barely get a job, you don’t know that I struggle in school, you don’t know my luck, You don’t know that I don’t have much to live for. With no friends and literally the worlds biggest loser. So stop saying that I should get help when all I’m trying to do, is follow through with plans that I had since I was 13. 

I don’t want to find help for it cause I’m basically helpless. Knowing that going through therapy is freaking expensive and group therapy gives me too much anxiety. So stop trying to help me. I don’t want your help.

Coping with anticipated death,"I need help with coping with my death. No, I don’t have cancer or anything like that. I’ve just been depressed and anxious for a really long time.... years for as long as I remember. My life isn’t mine, but that’s a long irrelevant story. The point is that I want to go. Now, but I’m afraid of dying... as in the afterlife. I believe in a higher being, but I accept that I don’t know all his nature. 

I read a well written article before about how it is for suicidal people to die. Why is the only way out for us to go a painful death?  Gunshot, overdose, hangings... all of which may make life worse if not carried out in a proper way. Then I began researching assisted death. Actually today. I found something called Medicine assistance in death MAID. It’s legal in 6 US States (including the one I reside in) and in Canada. It’s a 6 month process to make sure you’re certain. I don’t know that if it’s just available for person who are terminally ill or people who want to be put out of their mental misery as well. I have to call and find out tomorrow. 

What am I here for?
Someone please tell me how to accept death. I have to go anyways one day. I’m working on convincing myself the afterlife is nothing to worry about because right now I feel like I’m trapped between a tunnel with hell on both ends. I need to believe the afterlife offers something better than my current state. I was raised Christian (im not one now), but hell scared me when I was a child and still does now. 

I don’t appreciate any comments asking me to re-evaluate my live and claiming I have so much to live for. You don’t know me and it’s just something you’re trying to write to help without any basis. 

Edit: I really need some insight. There’s only one response and I’m having a lot of anxiety right now. I don’t want to be too  overwhelmed. Even though I want to go right now - I still want to go peacefully. I want to go right now.

"Blindfolded by my own destiny,","Everything about myself is unbearable.

I am a student who would very willingly commit suicide because I do not have a purpose. Over the past year my life has been going downhill. I am young but I feel like this is the age I am suppose to be destine to die at. I see no light wherever I go. I am blindfolded by despair and agony. I am a liar, fraud, and most importantly a failure. I am not a good son, friend and brother to anyone around me.

&#x200B;

I had surgery last year around this time due to alcoholic consumption and thats when I realized I am not the person I once was. I have been prescribed medication because I know I cannot take it because I does not help. Only 2 people know my true feelings about myself. They have tried to help but do they actually care for my well being? I have accepted that I cannot live past the age 20. That is okay to me know because I cannot carry on. If I really do kill myself soon I will be okay to burn in hell forever because anything will be better than this suffering.

For those who care, this is my cry for help. Someone, anyone, please help me finish this struggle.

I think of killing myself every single day. Every. Single. Day. 

Why isn't it okay if I go do this? I wish someone would just tell me it's okay.

Still, everyday I think of walking out on my job, because of my boss & then going to kill myself, since because of physical & emotional issues I'll never get a decent job again, let alone insurance.

Everyday I think my boss will do something treat me like garbage & not apologize - I think she amoral, but other times she can be nice. Her temperament is very mercurial.

I'll then walkout & end my life, since again - I'm 52, have health issues (they're well manged), emotional issues & the fact she'll tell them things about me that will not let me get hired ever - there certain things a former employer can say that will let a potental employer know.

Everyday I think they'll let me go after the new year saying it's the economy, or something else. That is a fear I've had for years & then I think I should just go ahead & carry out my plan. I have one that would take me to the West Texas desert - I'll see some nice scenery as I make my trip at least, even deserts can be beautiful. It's not going to be too bad of a last view - even thought what I have in mind is going to most likely be painful.

The elephant in the room- rant,"I’m going to make this short or else I’d be writing a novel.
I’ve had suicidal thoughts for a very long time, even before I knew I had depression. I’ve attempted it more than once in the past year. My first ‘official’ attempt left an elephant in the room that is still here to this day. 
For the first and last time, I decided to slit my wrists sometime last year.  Perhaps it would have worked if I waited a few more minutes, but midway through 17 year old me panicked. I begged my brother to take me to the hospital with blood soaked arms and he did. I was put on suicide watch and made my mom miss 2 days of work. Which she made a big deal out of, though I understand. My mother refused therapy and refused to get the medicine I needed to help my lack of potassium.  (We have another elephant in the room, her name is ‘Eating disorder’- yay). 
After things simmered down, my brother and mother no longer talked to me and I was ignored for months. I could tell they dreaded me by the insults they gave me when I did try to speak with them. Tensions were high in the house for a while and eventually, I had to shove everything under the rug as well if I wanted to speak with my family. 
 I want therapy and lord knows I need it, but I will only succeed in making my mom angry by mentioning it. Which I find amusing, seeing how she has also claimed to have depression several times (Sort of off topic, but this was revealed when I found messages on her phone that indicated she was cheating on my dad. When confronted about it, she faked swallowing pills as a ‘suicide attempt’. We freaked out only to have the doctors tell us there wasn’t anything in her system and then blamed us lol.) I don’t know if her own suicide attempt makes her doubt me, but it’s come to the point where even I tend to doubt if I truly have depression or am just exaggerating it.

Anywho-It’s a bit strange, but the idea of taking medication sounds like a literal dream. Though I’m afraid that at this pace, it’s going to be a while before I am able to receive it with or without family support.

I don't know how to make friends.,"I've been thinking about suicide for years, and that fact sort of comforts me, because it's all thought, and no action. The problem is, I just really don't care anymore. My kids are grown up and doing well on their own, which is great. The two friends that I have are mostly too busy for me because I am several years divorced and living alone.

I've tried to make friends different ways over the years, but it just doesn't work, a big part of it is probably because I'm single divorced.

I don't drink, I don't smoke, I Don't dance, I just exist anymore. I don't have any hobbies anymore that I enjoy. When I consider how I'm living, I don't think I deserve friends, much less a girlfriend or a wife.

I write this because I don't know anybody that I'm willing to tell this under my real name. I don't know what to do to fix myself. I still have random thoughts of doing something simple so I simply don't wake up, whether it's flying in my car with the engine running in the closed garage, or just stopping eating altogether, which I don't do much of anymore anyway.

I’m giving up marijuana so I can achieve my professional and personal goals, but not being able to mute my feelings with pot is a nightmare. I feel too much. I’ve been crying most of the day - not necessarily because I’m sad, but more like a general distress and unease.

I don’t feel suicidal, but the desperation I feel is very similar. I feel in small crisis. Free fall. I want to hide under the covers and never come out.

I’m posting here because I’m hoping someone with similar experiences (on/off suicidal depression, heavy marijuana use) might be able to expose the light at the end of the tunnel. How long until this rollercoaster of emotions evens out? How can I make this easier on myself? 

I’m feeling alone in this experience in kind of a frightening way - any comments are very much appreciated

Suicidal or just depression/anxiety?,"I am diagnosed with depression and every year it seems to get worse. This year I started having very disturbing thoughts about killing myself. They aren’t just random “ugh I should kill myself” but I actually genuine feel like that. My panic/anxiety attacks (idk what to call them) are bad. Besides the attacks, I cry almost every other day. Last week I hadn’t cried for 4 days and then on the 5th day I had 3 attacks in a day. I had planned to kill myself of the 20th of December of this year but I didn’t manage to. I feel very cowardly?? Idk I just feel guilty for living yeh know...I’m not someone that looks looks like I have got depression but yeah...nowadays, when I feel depressed or have a panic attack I legit want to jump from the balcony of my room.

I'm so close to just doing it. I can't keep living like this anymore...,"My husband left me back in August. He didn't allow me to drive or work, so when he left...I was just dropped. He didn't care about me, he didn't care that him leaving would cause me to struggle so much. I'm lucky to have family who pays my house, which it's just a tiny house on family land that is $350 a month, really not bad at all...but still - I know I'm lucky for atleast that. But what I really need help with is driving or getting a vehicle or just general stuff that will actually HELP me move forward in my life. I'm stuck. I'm actually stuck in my life. I can't afford anything on my own, I have enough to pay for driving lessons - which my husband sent me the money for - I do have my permit and that took me forever to convince my dad to take me to go get. I thought from there I could have my parents help me learn to drive, but there was always an excuse. There's always an excuse. I plan on scheduling my driving lessons after the 1st of the year, but from there...what am I gonna do? Get my license just to be stuck because I can't get a car. My mother and father have point blank told me they won't let me drive either of theirs, they're too broke to afford one for me. Talk to my grandparents they say, and anytime I do try talking to them they change the subject. 

Everyone thinks if I drive I'll just go out and party or go meet up with men. And honestly, I would meet up with men pretty often. I'm NOT a partier at all, but I do currently go out and drink occasionally because that's pretty much the only time I get to get out of the house. But that's not the point at all. I want to get a job, I want to be able to pay for things myself. I want to be able to move forward with my life and I just can't. No one who should be helping me do certain things are not even helping. 

I can't keep living like this. I just can't. I don't want to. I fucking hate what my life is now and I don't see it getting any better. ",Anxious-Wife,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aafkqs/im_so_close_to_just_doing_it_i_cant_keep_living/,12/28/2018/23:22:54,aafkqs,SuicideWatch

I almost killed myself the other day,"I’m a longtime lurker and I tend to not comment or post things. It makes me anxious and just feel uncomfortable in a way, but I don’t know who else to turn to at the moment. Oh, I’m on mobile, so I’m sorry for any funky things that happen with the format.

Two days ago I completely lost it. Full on breakdown, panic attack, anger, everything. My parents couldn’t calm me down, I was a mess. I packed my bags and was planning on leaving in an organized manner until my mom said something that just set me off. I left without my bags, money, pills, ANYTHING. I just had my phone.

I made it halfway to where I was going before I realized I couldn’t kill myself without my pills. So I just hung out for an hour and then went back home. I continued having a breakdown, and was thinking about jumping out of my window. My parents wouldn’t leave my room and I couldn’t do anything while they were there. I couldn’t cut myself, so instead of doing that, I punched a hole through the wall. A fucking hole. I’m pretty scared of violence and a generally low key person, I tend to not even raise my voice, so this shocked me. I was so scared of myself and a whole new level of self hatred arose. I could not believe I had the capability to do something like that. I was fucking terrified.

They’re unaware of my suicidal thoughts/tendencies/ideation, you get the idea. So when I asked to be taken to the hospital, they brushed it off. I planned on killing myself that night.

Obviously, I didn’t. It ended up being a pretty chilled out night, and I just went to bed. But I’m wallowing in self hatred now, scared of myself, disappointed in myself, and overall hating myself. I’m so broken and I can’t get fixed. I keep telling myself to wait for a little bit, until after the holidays. I think I’ll do it then, after the holidays. Maybe I won’t, but if this keeps up... I have no doubt that it’ll be over before we get too far into 2019. 

I’m just so numb. I don’t wanna be here anymore. I hurt so much.

I've failed at everything I've ever attempted.,"I got dumped on the 22nd by the person I love, and the only one that has ever loved me. It was more than justified, and completely my fault.

&#x200B;

I found out on the 24th that I lost all of my financial aid because I've withdrawn from or failed too many classes to maintain pace.

&#x200B;

I spent Christmas completely alone, staying (borderline) sane only by staying active.

&#x200B;

I managed to land a job at a bar, but during my first day today no-one was showing me what to do, and I became way too anxious and felt useless - so I slipped out the back after barely an hour. This is the third job I've lost this year. All my fault as well.

&#x200B;

I have zero people in my life that I can talk to. I fully expected to spend winter break alone, but it was never meant to be this lonely. My phone only vibrates from this one app I use, and the tiny surge of hope that it might be someone has disappeared already. She was the only person that really knew me or cared, and now there is no one. I don't even have anyone to tell the simple stuff, like when I got a job - much less about how much I hate myself. I can't even go to the school counselor anymore because they're closed, and when they reopen I can't afford to be a student now. I want to make friends but I've never been fun or good at talking, and I have no money to go out, and even once students are back in town I can't join clubs without being a student.

&#x200B;

I just payed January's rent, and now I have 20 dollars to my name - along with $600 of credit card debt I've needed to survive, which I was going to pay off when I got my financial aid refund. I didn't have a guarantor to sign for me, so my landlord notified me when I moved in that they have the right to sue me or evict me if I'm one day late on rent. I'd rather be dead or homeless than go back to live with my family.

&#x200B;

I've been barely getting by for the past year, and now all this happened in the span of one week. I'm closer to the edge than I've been since my last attempt, and I don't know how the fuck I am supposed to get through this anymore.

My  Story: I have been depressed since i was about 13 and im now 27. Life  has gotten progressively worse for me. I have been thru horrible  physical, mental and sexual abuse by my ex, homelessness, lost so many  very special loved ones and family members. One person so dear to me and  so precious and innocent and special died tragically and it kills me,  literally crushes my soul everyday waking up realizing they are dead and  didnt even get to hardly live.

He knows that i  have severe anxiety, ptsd, aspergers and depression but he still ignores  me. Last time he ignored me a whole month and cheated on me with a girl  and even moved her into his house only to find out she was seeing 2  other guys and was using him. But I still love him. I want him back. Im  such a fool to love him I guess.

Im just  done.. life is so pointless..its a means to an end, a cyclical pattern  of suffering and just a massive let down. no one cares about me. I just  wish i never existed.

I almost killed myself at a behavioral health clinic.,"This happened about a half an hour ago, and I’m still shaking.

I had just finished my second therapy appointment. It went somewhat well. I was nervous, and jumpy.

At the end of the appointment my therapist gave me my paper. My eyes drifted to the problem list.


Bipolar disorder 2, knew that. Panic disorder with agoraphobia and moderate panic attacks. Knew that. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Yup. Substance use disorder. I dispute that, but I see why they would think so. And then...

Borderline personality disorder. That was new.

I started to spiral. Crying. I asked the therapist as she walked me out if it was true. She said it was just words on paper, that we would talk about it at the next appointment. But I was already drowning.

She told me there was a bathroom in the hallway. She told me to go practice my breathing exercises.

I went to the bathroom, but I did not do breathing exercises.

I cried. Hard. For 20 minutes straight. I googled borderline, and came to the conclusion that I could never find love and I would eventually hurt and chase off everyone who loves me.

Then someone came into the bathroom and I shut up.

I needed somewhere more private. And frankly, I had quite the pick.

The clinic is on the second floor of a mostly empty building. There are plenty of grey unpainted rooms that you can simply wander into.

But I ended up picking the stairwell. No one used the stairs.

You see where this is going.

I sat on the second floor landing. I cried for awhile. Then I saw something strange.

Bird shit.

Did this place lead to the roof?

Curious, I climbed the stairs. Up and up and up, 7 stories. I reached the door that lead to the roof. I tried to push it open. Locked.

Too bad. I would have liked to see the view of the city.

I leaned on the safety rail and looked down. I was so high up, and the concrete floor was right below. Beckoning.

I stood on the lowest rung of the safety rail. Staring. Jump. Jump. Jump.

My legs started shaking. My breathing sped up. A tear rolled down my face and fell. I had to decide if I would follow it.

I stepped away. My thoughts were crazy. I felt invigorated. My heart was thumping it was a rush.

Now I’m sipping a mimosa over a veggie burger (first time I had one), with sweet potato fries and butternut squash soup.

I don’t know if I regret not jumping yet.",waytoomanyfandoms,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aaehgo/i_almost_killed_myself_at_a_behavioral_health/,12/28/2018/21:20:55,aaehgo,SuicideWatch

Tired,"Im not unmotivated. I regularly go to the gym, im attractive (or so i've been told), im pursuing my career in art and my skills are pretty decent, i have friends who care about me even if i have a family that doesn't.

In fact this year has been even better than any other in terms of overcoming my social anxiety and intimacy issues.

However I am overly self aware and Im constantly trapped in my own head. I lack a close enough connection with anyone in my life to tell them about my depressive episodes and suicidal tendencies.
The last person i was that close to was my ex, and while i have gotten over her ive realised that even if i get that close to someone again, their presence is not permanent.

I cant rely on anyone else
I cant rely on myself

Recently ive been looking at places in my area that would be strong enough to hold a noose and my body. I cant do it in my house since i'd likely be stopped.

Im tired....

Planning a Suicide calms me.,"Every time I get stressed and have an anxiety epsiode, my mind subconsciously plans a method to kill myself. 
And before I know it, 30 mins will be passed and I will be calm as a clam. I haven't gathered courage to attempt again but I sure have thought of every possible way and calculated the risks, amount of time it takes, availablity of such materials assisting suicide, effective time to attempt, etc etc. 

Everyday I drown a little more into the depth, I can't stop drowning, everytime I think this is little better, I drown 100 times more, it's like I can't even be at peace for 2 days then it hits me again. I am afraid of being 'happy' because I know the good deal of it is waiting for me. 
I can't talk to my friends, even though I made some through online, I can't openly talk to them or cry to them because i don't want them to drown with me in my depression. 

Hopefully I can somehow gain courage to atleast attempt a little one, may not be deadly but gotta start somewhere again. That's all I can be 'hopeful' for.

How to help my suicidal ex when it seems like he wants to get back together?,"I randomly checked my instagram a couple of days ago and noticed that my ex had uploaded pictures and captions with a strong theme of depression, suicide, and uncertainty towards the world and himself. I checked his feed and he hasn't posted anything for a year before uploading 3 pictures back to back in a span of minutes. 

My ex and I had a not-so-smooth end in our relationship about 2 years ago where he ghosted me and I felt disposable but felt like I had no other choice but to let it go, which results in a strange resentful and bittersweet feeling when I have thoughts of him. 

At this time, I haven't been in communication with him for a year and we are civil with each other but this worried me and seemed like a cry for help, so I asked him if he was okay. (At this point of my story it's going to be a back and forth to recap our messages.) At first he said he was fine but then asked me why I messaged him. I told him that I had good intentions and asked again if he was okay. He said that he has been on a downward spiral with depression. I tried to reassure him and asked how long this has been. He says that he doesn't want to talk about it at risk of receiving pity. I tell him that I don't feel pity but I am worried about him. He opens up and says that in a way he misses me but he doesn't want to invest emotions. I ask him what he meant by that and his answer turns vague so I ask for clarification but he doesn't get back to me.

Knowing that he posted this at Christmas, my concern just grew more since I worry he's isolated and his feelings of depression being exaggerated due to the holidays. I decided to leave the conversation for the time being and went to sleep with some of those feelings of hurt coming back again since it seems like I'm getting ghosted again, but I know not to take it personally.

The next evening comes and I feel like I have to convey a message that I am here and present and don't want him to make stupid decisions based on depression. My main concern is that I don't want him to feel isolated because as someone who's experienced depression during the holidays before, it can be very tough. 

Now here's the part where he opens up (He has a tendency to bottle things that I've observed in the past so I can imagine this is rough on him). He tells me he wants more than my presence and hates that I'm dating my boyfriend now. (I met my boyfriend through him but we saw each other again on an app after half a year of when my exbf ghosted me.) He proceeds to open up and says that he feels that I was the best he ever had and he fucked up our relationship and feels that this is karma for his faults. He proceeds to self-deprecate and says it will be better to off himself in the future. And then he tells me that his cat, who I knew he was very close with, has passed so he doesn't have an animal companion. These messages sent me on an emotiomal rollercoaster but I tried my best to collect myself to compose a message of reassurance, me telling him that it hurts me to see him in this pain, and I asked him if there was anyone he has in contact for comfort. I fear that I went around his first messages of saying he misses me because I know I can't provide him any romantic offerings as I am in a happy and committed relationship.

He has read my message and hasn't replied to me since then. In hindsight, maybe I should've made the conversation lighter and not too focused on his depression to make it seem like he's just a ""normal person"". I'm wondering if I should ask him to go for tea with me and talk so his fear that people would pity him would dissolve since it's a message that doesn't seem to focused on his depression?  I'm really not sure how to proceed with this and I'm very worried about his well-being. I don't think he'll respond to the idea of a medical professional well but I feel like I can slowly bring it up if we do have a conversation IRL where he can't ghost me.

Big decision to make,"32/M/loser. Push shopping trolleys for a living. Live with mother and her boyfriend. Depressed af and constantly miserable. No ambition or motivation.

Recently, I went to Japan and met a girl. I lied to her and told her I had a better job, could drive, lived alone etc because no one dates me in my loser state. She completely loves this fake version of me. It's a lot of fun and I'm happy when I'm with her.

Back home I am miserable. I spend all my time when I'm not working sat alone in my bedroom.

Today, I told my mother that I'm handing in my notice at work on Monday and going back to Japan. I have  about 5-6 thousand pounds left of my grandfather's inheritance. I will probably last 3-4 weeks there. When I return I will be jobless and homeless.

If I stay here as is, I won't leave my job. I'll probably die doing this. Either choice could result in my suicide, before my grandfather died, I was already about to attempt suicide.

I don't know which choice to make. I don't have long to decide.",fbjyfkn,1,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aadab4/big_decision_to_make/,12/28/2018/19:13:41,aadab4,SuicideWatch
"At the end, but stuck.","I have been having intrusive thoughts for about 20 months. I want to kill myself. The only thing putting me off was the fact I’m breastfeeding my daughter and she couldn’t survive without me. Now she is nearly 2. She still feeds but she can survive without me, so can my 6 year old.

I want to end it. I bring nothing to my family. I don’t work right now. I went from school to college to uni, then had my youngest. I’ve only worked at one place whilst I was in college. I’m nervous to work again even though I have a degree now. 

My partner brings in money. I contribute nothing financially. I feel so low I can not motivate myself to have the house sparkling clean every day. 

I am fat.
I am ugly. 
I am worthless. 
I am a failure, of a partner and a mother. 

My issue?? Whenever I think of commiting suixide I can’t decide how... step in front of a vehicle or off a bridge onto the motorway could ruin someone else’s life.... tablets will just leave me in pain for days then I’ll get better... I have no access to firearms... sleeping tablets aren’t strong enough...

And the other issue? If I think of something all I think of is my kids growing up without me... like I want to die but I don’t want to emotionally or mentally scar them... would it be better to run away then do it so they just think I ran away, not died?

A dog's life,"I wouldn't have made it this long without my dog. Last thing on this earth that truly cares about me. As long as he is around, I will be too. People can be told, but he wouldn't understand how I could leave him, so I won't. 

But someday, he will. Dogs don't live as long as people, and mine has already made it past the long side of breed average lifespan. When he does, my last reason to be here goes with him, and I'll follow shortly after. 

I have the spot, I have the rope, I've tied the knots enough to do it with my eyes closed, or full of tears. One small step, one long drop, one last goodbye. Someday soon. 

The only good thing about the waiting, is that it gets easier. I've spent so long hiding the pain it has become automatic. I'll be heading to antoher funeral later, a good spot to be suicidal. There are so many sad faces around I won't worry about being seen.

I said I would kill myself on my birthday last year,"The last big fight I got into with my dad was March 29th 2018. I said if shit didn’t get better I’d kill myself on my next birthday.
9 months later I still walk on eggshells at home, I still get treated like the white trash I am at work, and I still ain’t really “close” with anybody. I could disappear tomorrow and it would take days for anybody to realize it. 

Don’t know what I’m still doing here. Literally my only will to continue to live and struggle and work is the thought of one day being able to live in the woods and not have to deal with this shit world anymore, and the very slight, nearly nonexistent possibility that one day a girl is able to see past my poor genetics and weirdness and love me. I’ve pretty much given up on that. Some people say I’m attractive, but I know they are lying because pretty much any woman I ever interact with is just shitty with me yeno. Like they aren’t mean unless we’re talking the managers at work but the pleasantness is just forced. It fucking crushes me every day to walk into the gas station and the face the lady makes when she knows she has to serve me. This world is pure and utter fucking shit and anybody that tells you otherwise doesn’t know what it’s like to be at the bottom.

Whether or not I end myself in March is unknown. I’ve been saying it and wanting to do it since when my brother started to get bad. I just felt like sharing and not writing it all down in my notebook because nobody cares enough to listen to me.

"I'm a Parasite, and New Years Eve I'm Gonna Destroy the Parasite","I've done nothing my entire life but take from my parents. I'm 20 and I've never thought about where I am and what I want to do in life. I was so absorbed by video games and youtube that I refused to work hard or study at all anywhere.  
I've been in community college for 2.5 years now and for the first two I had no idea what I was doing. I started believing that life has no purpose and it eats at me a lot, but I still could've looked for something to work on. 

Anyways, this semester was my final hour, my saving grace, my one chance to redeem myself. I would work hard, forgo games and videos, and become something. I didn't stop watching youtube though, and I relapsed on the games halfway through the semester. I ended up with two C's and a B, and that B was in a class that any monkey could've made an A in. Literally one grade decided I made a B and it was because I was lazy about it and think about it until the night before. I thought I was in the clear after that, it would be harder to get into the program I want, but I would get a chance to still retain some sort of self-respect. I wouldn't have been hurt if I simply hadn't been accepted. However, I looked last night and I need a minimum GPA of 2.8 to get in, and mine's 2.76.

Now, you may say, ""2.76? That's not that bad, you can just take one class, make an A in it and get in, no problem!"" I don't think I can stay here for another year though, continually being reminded that I am a disappointment, that my parents would be happier just dealing with their one successful kid. If I cared about myself I would deal with it, but honestly, I can't care anymore. I'm not depressed, I'm lazy, I only want to play and philosophize. I also don't want to be 30 and living with my parents either, that's not fair to them. None of this is. If I were an honest person, I would've told them from the start of the semester that I was watching youtube, that I was playing games, but I'm in college and it's my responsibility.

Happy Friday,"I shot myself in my chest aimed for my heart but missed. The bullet broke my ribs and pierced my lung. Lung collapsed. I had surgery, 2 blood transfusions, also 3 chest tubes and was in the hospital for months. It was the most painful experience I’ve ever had to endure and wish it on no one. 2 years later I’m 21 and so broken. My ribs constantly hurt and I don’t breathe the same. My body doesn’t work the same. I have nerve damage on my scars. I self mutilated my body. My spirit. No one to blame but myself. My mental state is even worse. Every day i wake up so angry that I’m still here!!! I didn’t ask to be saved, I was almost dead, I felt it in my bones. You know that cold that you can’t shake? The inside of me was cold, so blankets didn’t help, only mocked me. I am so toxic wrapped up in my own shit, I push everyone I get close to far away. I am incapable of loving anybody, let alone myself. I wish I didn’t feel this way but I do. Today is a really bad day. Anyone else relate? And if so, what’s so wrong with dying? Why is everyone so scared? So selfish? To keep my spirit trapped here when it’s clearly aching so badly to move on. The pain is rather dull now. I am numb. I’d only like to cleanse my mind. I can’t stand to be alone, but hate to be around people at the same time. I hardly leave my room. My friends I have left are over my shit too.

Didn’t think I’d be posting here today.,"I’m not depressed and have never been one to succumb to my emotions. But this point in my life it’s difficult to see myself living another year. Not because I don’t want to but because I don’t see how it’s possible.

I have a wife and two kids that I love. We’re in a mountain of debt and plan on filing for bankruptcy.

We started a retail business this year that did well at first and the last few months have sunk us deeper and deeper. We have the potential to make good money but now it’s all flowing out faster than it’s coming in.

I’ll never be able to pay everyone back that I owe.

But I have a $500k insurance policy that can.

My family would be taken care of financially, but if I were gone they would be devastated. 

The impending doom seems to be getting more and more real. A decision has to be made and it needs to be drastic. I just don’t know what it will be.

I am humiliated by the thought of failure and letting people down. It almost sounds worse than being gone. I just can’t bear the thought of my kids growing up without a father. That’s the main thing keeping me going strong right now.

Hey people. This is just something about me and my story,"Hi my name is cooper and I am 14 years old. I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and clinical depression at the age of 13 (this year) I have also been associated and committed self harm or sh for short. I grew up a pretty normal average life with my family. We were very close and would always hang out at the beach or go places. I loved it. And I still do. But the family has fallen apart. Or at least I’ve broken off from them. I’m tearing up just thinking about it. My moods got worse and my anxiety heightened to the point where getting out of bed was mere impossible and I would dread school to the point of blocking my door every morning before school to make sure my parents couldn’t get in. But of course I unblocked it and came to my senses again every time. I’ll cut to the chase. I’ve tried committing suicide three times of which I will not go into detail for this page. All three I have survived. Two of which have been this year. I met this girl in February. She was beautiful. And I asked her out. We’ve been dating ever since. But sometimes I believe things have gotten out of hand. For example expecting me to get food when I have no money and then getting angry/sad when I can’t get it, not doing things that often (dates) (I also have very bad social anxiety and my communication skills are whack) she knows about how bad my anxiety is, she even goes to lengths of blaming me for things that weren’t my fault and also mentioning things over and over again to try and get her way which always works. I see her nearly every single day and when I don’t she gets sad and sometimes she’ll get mad at me even when it’s out of my control!! I don’t know it just seems so out of the ordinary. Ever since I met her I’ve been getting further and further away from my family to calling her when sleeping to calling her all day everyday. I feel obliged to do it and if I don’t call her then she’ll get mad and if I need to go she will get sad. It hurts me to say it but I don’t think this relationship is good for me. It put me to the edge of killing myself two times.  I always feel obliged to do whatever she says or i risk making her upset or arguing. I’m so done with it and my thoughts of suicide have just been growing and growing and it’s getting to the edge again. I’m wondering if it’s mental abuse or something along the lines of that. But yeah just wanted to give some insight on my life and yeah if someone is reading this remember that if you need to talk I’m always here. Thank you.

I am in dire need of help,"I've read a lot of stories on here so I guess it's time I posted. 
I've been considering suicide for months now and it's just getting worse. I have only a few friends and I feel very dissatisfied with myself. I don't get on the best with the tiny amount of family I have. My girlfriend is almost everything keeping me here right now. She's amazing but I don't think she can help me anymore. I feel like I'm constantly suffering and sometimes thoughts will just hit me and I want it to be over. One day I just don't think I'll stand it anymore and I'll be gone.

So I'm asking for something I should do. I try my hardest to keep my mind off bad stuff by doing things I like and being with other people, but my mood gets ruined and I feel like lying down and doing nothing. I'm desperate for help because I don't want to leave yet and I can't get my girlfriend to go away. It'll hurt her so much and I can't do that.

I can’t handle life. I don’t think there’s another way out.. but I also don’t want to die.,"I wrote out a suicide note sometime last week. I didn’t have any particular plans set out or dated in mind, but just wanted to have something on paper in case something happened, or maybe to sort of serve as a wake up call to bring to mind the people that would be hurt if I decided to leave. I’m 21, and a college student. I’d done well academically for pretty much all my life, but last semester, with all the things going on personally and mentally, I just couldn’t do it. Failed 3 of 5 classes. Next semester isn’t looking much better... It sort of puts you in your place. I’ve never had a job before (that must sound pathetic). I’ve always been too afraid that if I had one I would mess things up for everyone, and I’m afraid that by this point, with no experience, that no one will want to hire me now, or ever. And if I can’t do well in school, then no one will have any reason to hire me. For medical reasons, my life is already pretty expensive, and I have no flow of income. How am I going to handle all of this in the future? Not to mention, and not the least of which... I’m transitioning from male to female. It’s... very hard to do that, even with fairly good circumstances for it. I’ve been medically transitioning via hormone therapy for a little over a year now, but I’m mortified now that my hair is falling out. The doctors think it’s telogen effluvium, due to a number of causes, probably chronic stress... and I _am_ stressed... almost all of the time. Suicidally depressed and anxious for a number of months now, and I’ve lost all the hope I had for a good life when I first started my journey. I don’t want to die. There are many people I love and who love me too. But... I don’t think I can handle life, and I don’t see how I’ll be able to make it. So I want to check out.. that way I won’t live long enough for everyone to be disappointed in me. Y’know? How do you go on? How do you get past this?",serindipitous275,3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aaavjx/i_cant_handle_life_i_dont_think_theres_another/,12/28/2018/14:45:55,aaavjx,SuicideWatch

Please...,"I'm sorry for leaving such a vague title but that's probably the #1 word that my heart says:

Please... just...
Please help...

#2 phrase is 'I'm sorry' 

For over a year I have struggled with severe depression and anxiety for even longer, but these last few months I have fallen asleep holding a knife to my throat at least 5 times.
 I'm a coward I want nothing more than to die because no matter how much I hope and dream and try, nothing gets better while the emptiness inside of me gets bigger.

I've written 2 suicide notes now but I still can't do it. I'm scared. I'm scared and I don't want to hurt others but I'm so tired and everytime I fall this deep I push harder and harder on the knife.

I've had so many extended periods where I felt awful and it was the love of my 5 year girlfriend that pulled me out and made me care about life. 
Now even she is gone.
I was making her miserable just like me - once I held a knife to my throat in front of her, I wanted to die because things felt to bad. Because I got so bad.

After she left me one of my best friends died. I'm just so empty now, I always have been but now it's all I have. I don't want to hurt my family. I don't want to hurt her because I still love her.

But sooner or later I think I'm going to kill myself and I'm sorry for sharing that with you guys and potentially extended my burden anywhere else. If it could just end with me I would dope up and jump off the Eiffel tower with a smile on my face.

The last straw,"I grew up in a very emotionally and sometimes physically abusive home. I remember the first time I wanted to kill myself I was about 9 or 10. 3rd grade. And it never got better. I never got better. I started drinking when I was 11 to numb the pain. I started cutting and burning myself when I was 12. I saw therapist after therapist, but nothing worked. 


At 14 I started to get chronic migraines and spent 3 months in the hospital on morphine. They never found what was wrong, so I started seeing a neurologist and therapist. I started and tried every anti depressant they could offer. Every anti anxiety medication. Nothing worked. 


I got into college through sheer determination, I wanted everyone to see that I was smart and could do something. I was always so stressed out. One day I found a lump on my throat. It was cancer. 22 years old. I am now cancer free, but the emotional toll was too much. I want to die every day. I wish the cancer had taken me. I started seeing a cancer therapist and taking new meds but again, nothing worked.


I finished my degree through treatment, and graduated with my bachelor's of science in biology at 23. Awesome. Got a job, but started being abused at the job. Left and went back to college job as manager, but I was now being abused by my store manager and coworkers. 


My parents house gets foreclosed on and my dad tells me never to speak to him again. My boyfriends (together 4 years) mom has dementia and is in a nursing home, his dad has stage 4 blood cancer (same kind I had but later stage) and will die within 5 years. 


Today at 26 I got let go from my job and have nothing to fall back on. Not my parents, not my boyfriends parents, nothing. After all the abuse, I've worked so hard, put in sooooooo much effort hell I made it out of poverty! That's amazing! First one in the family to get a degree! But it doesn't matter. No matter how hard I try, nothing works.


I'm still depressed. I still want to die. Today more than ever.

I can’t turn 18,"It’s still a few month until my birthday, but even thinking about it puts me in so much distress. Turning 18 is nothing but a reminder that I’m a failure. All I ever did was to disappointment everyone’s expectations, even if they were incredibly basic things you’d expect from everyone. In addition, everyone that means something to me will be gone around that time. They’ll leave and I’m not someone you stay in contact with. It’s easy to forget about me. (My family gave up on me long ago so there really isn’t anyone to else)
I absolutely don’t want to be 18 (I hate that this number means so much to me even though I know it’s just a number) and nothing seems to be okay during that time. How to prevent everything from happening is the easier part, but to come up with a detailed plan is somewhat harder. My mind has been on it for the last few days, sketching out more and more complicated ideas. Thinking about dates, logistics, notes, expenses, methods, places - nothing I really want to share.
But there’s two fears continuously emerging: the fear of failing and the definite decision that comes with committing suicide.

I think I’m done.,"I’ve thought about posting here for a while now, but whenever I felt like it in the past, I decided not too. However, I feel like I need to vent/rant about my current situation. 

TL;DR - I’ve had issues with my mother and my own mental health for years. She stepped out of my life for 5 to 7 years and she hid in her room while doing so. I basically raised my self with my dads help. And now she’s upset that she missed out on teaching me important life skills, and she is upset that it’s taken me so long to figure out my life. Earlier today she go fed up and threw me out.

BTW this post is very long.

I’ll start with a little bit of back story. I’m 21M, and like most of us I’ve had some mental health issues for a while now. This year things have hit an all time low, I’ve never felt this depressed before and it’s scary. 

Timeline:

January 2008: Our apartment gets burnout and we have to stay with my dad for a few months

May/June 2008: We move into our new townhouse 

June 2008 - December 2010: Our relationship begins to change as she starts to lock herself in her room. I still hangout with my dad and do activities such as see movies, go to sporting events, and festivals. During Dec 2010 she has a huge argument with her sister and this is when their relationship gets fucked. This is the year in which she stops going to work. She’s luckily apart of a union so she would get some disability money.

Mid 2010 - Early 2015: During this time period a lot happens. She basically only leaves her room when she absolutely has too [to get food, go to the bathroom, make me food, or go to appointments] during this time I start seeing a counsellor and tell her about this as well as other issues. She still hasn’t gone back to work at this point.

2011 - Present: My aunt gets me into acting/background performing. So I work as an extra every once in a while mostly during summer, winter, and spring break.

2012 - 2013: I have thoughts about working part time at McDonald’s or the movie theatre. Both parents tell me to just focus on school.

Early 2015 - Mid 2015: She begins to take an interest in my life again when she notices that I’ve stopped going to school. Her, my school’s counsellor [not the one that I was seeing] and I talk about how I can still graduate that year. We make a plan and it basically involved me not having to go to school that much and just finishing certain projects and taking a few test. She would still get upset at me for not going to school even after we had that plan in place.

June 2015 - July 2015: 
After graduating I begin working my first 9-5 full time job at a warehouse. I worked there for a month and hated it. Mostly because of the people and how stupid the training was. The people were mean and annoying and after the first week I had anxiety about working there. I would worry about going in there for each shift and I’d also worry about doing something wrong. There was an opportunity to stay on after the summer in the original job offer but I knew I couldn’t keep working there. The actual job it’s self wasn’t too bad but they let some of us go because they didn’t have enough work for all of us. There were lots of times where we would be standing around doing nothing and they would come in and yell at us. So that started to turn me of from full time work.

August 2015 - November 2016: 
I worked every once in a while in film. I didn’t know where I wanted to work during that time period and I had a decent amount of savings. So I just stayed with the film job. I looked into working at other warehouses but most were super far away. She went back to work for about 6 months and then stopped again.

July 2016: I started clubbing and I enjoyed going out and meet new people.

November 2016: My dad passed away and my world was flipped upside down, cut in half and flung out of the milky way. That’s basically my dramatic way of saying that I was pretty mind fucked by him passing away. 

November 2016 - May 2017: Definitely one of the toughest periods of my life other than this whole year. I started seeing a new counsellor through my moms work [the cut off age for my other one was 18 and I Was 19 at this point]. And I was trying to get back to normal mentally, trying to heal through working out and going to the club. Basically doing fun things. I worked at a few more warehouses but not for very long and I continued to work in film as well.

May 2017 - August 2017: At this point any money I had was almost gone. In June I began working at my city’s amusement park. I hated the people there as well and the job was super boring. The pay also sucked, I was barely able to buy basic stuff with each cheque. In August the job ended. 

In September I found out about some odd jobs through someoneI met on set. You know those people u see handing out free chips, drinks, etc or promoting some event on the street? Yeah those types of jobs. They pay well but are mostly super inconsistent. 

October 2017 - Now: I’ve been working those jobs and still applying to other places for full time or part time. And she still hasn’t gone back to work, although she used to mention going back.

That was probably still super fucking long to read but I tried to shorten it as much as I could. 

Now for the rain reason of my post:

I’ve been screwed financially for over a year...

Those jobs were good because they pay a lot more than minimum wage per hour however, they can be super inconsistent like working on set. I’ve also just been fucked by luck over the past year and a half as well, I’ll try to provide a few examples.

In November 2017 there was a 3 week long job lined up which would have provided me a decent cushion. And about a week and a half before it started my phone broke. So I was unable to work because they wanted everyone to be apart of the What’s app group. That’s the best example I can think of atm. 

But shit like that has been happening every time I’ve been about to get somewhere and I’m sick and tired of it. During the first 6 months of 2018 there were so many times where I would have to choose between food and deodorant, or some over necessary item. 

I would even apply to places that I didn’t care to work at just to be able to have some cash and I wouldn’t hear back from them. At least once a week I would just sit there and feel super depressed. I was depressed in general but during those times it was like there was a dark rain cloud above me and I wpuldonly think negative thoughts. I would also browse this subreddit during those times. January-May of this year I would feel like that 3 times a week. And evey time something would get fucked up I would feel like that. I’d think to
Myself “what’s the point in me even trying anymore” and “I hate this situation and o hate that I’m stuck”.

I tried to start seeing another counsellor
Or the one from my moms work but that has been a mess as well. I got tired of having no money and no temporary escapes from the situation [clubbing, video games, etf] because those all cost... you guessed it, money. This summer was a bit better but it still wasn’t great. This month seemed like it was going well. I had a new job lined up that would be started in January. And now for the main reason for me posting.

Earlier today, about 3 hours ago, she kicked me out. And it was weird because it was over something so small. We have had a lot of bigger arguments this year so I was surprised when she told me to get out. I grabbed my phone and my bag and left. I’ve been sitting here in this McDonald’s writing and editing down this post for an hour and a half now. I’m not sure what to do next. The anxiety, and stress, and depression has been unbearable this year. I’ve realized that my options were to either work somewhere and hate it [Which I did try to do a few times but after a month I just couldn’t do it mentally anymore] or find some part time work, [which hasn’t been going well either] or continue to struggle with my current situation.

Is anyone there I'm here,"I have felt this way before and its amazing to notice how much I can really get done when I have the full motivation to follow through with anything I set myself up for today. I woke up after having spill my guts out the other day about how worthless the egotistical side of me thought I was. I got a call from a website I was interested in recieving notifications from, but I did not think it would have lead to an awesome conversation with a counselor that would later lead to an enrollment starting February 2nd. So after that my day felt great because I was talking about my future and planning it at the same time almost all morning. After that was over I begun to see how my state was elevated and was on a roll after that. Constantly moving and I wasn't in bed for the first time in a good while. I thought to myself I have this energy to do things so I might as well take it as far as I can because who knew when I would have this feeling again. And I did still have that normal anxiety that comes and goes for no reason at times but still that didn't keep me from slowing my roll haha its like I was a machine programmed to maximize self and family contentedness and minimize the opposite. It was a real head changer I feel this is all I need and it is. In the whole day I managed to interact several times over the amount of time I'd been interacting just this past week. In addition I was able to affix a long term short term and even a mid term plan from the next couple of days over the span of a couple of years. Long term being the enrollment, short term being job hunting, and mid term being applying what I learn to personal and professional projects. But it only gets much better because I also recently found out about a company I wouldn't mind staying in a career with both possibly before graduating and for dang sure after graduating with an accredited information technology bachelors. So all in all this was a great day and I can confidently say that I surpassed my max when it came to efficiency today. I applied to jobs and found out about many others with great opportunities. Noticed mom had something to say and it was great news. Listened and talked to my older brother about kicking the drinking and smoking and about having an ever progressing mentality. Played a Godfather board game that all us brothers love playing 3 today (a new record). Finally I helped out my dad with his practice exam for the drivers license. And now here I am writing at 2:10 am in the morning because I just had to log in my whole day today bevause maybe one day when its not the best day I can look at this and possibly find the secret sauce between the lines that will help keep me motivated as I was today. Although if anything I think I already have it and that it's what my brother told me the night before when I broke down crying crossfaded which is to just be human pretty much and that its okay to feel a certain way so long as I let it out and keep moving forward no matter what it might mean for me. Also that it might seem like the past has got a hold on us but the past is nothing compared to now and what awaits us in the future. For we were all meant to love one another and my younger brother told me that if I loved the the world that if I loved life that life would love me back and right then as those words filled my head its as if I felt the universe wrap itself around me as a blanket feeling at ease.


I have to say that this wisdom is what led me to hear the man out on the phone early that morning. And I heard him out because he is a person just like the counselor who enrolled me and the business lady I contacted. And me showing just a little empathy and listening brought out opportunities. Now I see and now I have no qualms with love because loving myself is loving you. Knowing we all have similar counteractions towards struggles like anxiety and depression brought me closer to the average person and I myself benefited from it greatly so now I am redemption and here I come world with open arms CHAOOOOO!

Now I am feeling sleepy so I will go to sleep but just because in the back of my head it feels as if tomorrow who knows what will happen and saying this I want to remain the same so to you in the future I give you this cookie okay just know how much you got done today and how many doors you opened with the help of loved ones from just a simple act of kindness and openess to explore. If for some reason something does not pan out the way it was supposed to and maybe that opened door has just closed know that deeply you have within you the full potential any day to open up more doors and if anything better than before because I mean this is a big world after all and there is so much one can't do in their life but there is so much to do that it makes life limitless. So go until your content open as many doors and try them all. Make it a trial notice the change in your life go with the flow and then change it again until you have truly found what you were meant to be doing like a ""you were born for this"" kind of feeling. That ultimate purpose will drive you harder than any external motivational speaker ever can. But for now just the thought of finding your true purpose and actively reaching more towards it is enough.

Looks like I'd never forgotten in the first place huh brother alright time for bed.

I love you.
I love myself and I am very proud of myself.
Goodnight.

P.S. I encourage you to keep up with these entries I especially like how empowering it sounds on a good day. Keep it up! As soon as the next good day comes and its fine if its not tomorrow but just do it at the end of the day you will know when to it just one of those days afterall. You may just find out a little more and who knows it may then just be enough for you to ascend to another level of realization like it has for me but remember first act throughout the day,challenge yourself and don't hold back your feelings. Truly enjoy the experience because on a good day you never know when you will get another day like it ;)",Note2selfy,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aa9ku7/is_anyone_there_im_here/,12/28/2018/11:33:49,aa9ku7,SuicideWatch

how can I support a suicidal ex?,"I recieved a message from my ex who I am rarely in contact with. At first it appeared to be a typical merry Christmas text, but he soon revealed that he's decided this will be his last Xmas. He said he spoke to his parents and they called the police and he's been hospitalized but he said there is nothing anyone can do. He said he's going to die on his 38th birthday in early January. His text read like a suicide note thanking me for the happiest times in his life. We have been friends for many years but since breaking up 2 years ago we are only rarely in touch. He has shared suicidal thoughts in the past and I've spoken to his best friend about it and he's made it through. He has been in counselling and on meds and has ""tried everything""... But this time he has shared very specific plans. This time when I spoke to his friend he was also more concerned. Although he is at the hospital, I'm so worried that he is not going to recover. I want to help him but also remain somewhat distant as an ex he is very emotional about... I'm afraid if I do or say the wrong thing it will haunt me forever. He has isolated himself from his band and friends and work. His mom is aware and his BFF is aware. What should I do? What shouldn't I do?

It feels like I’m screaming for help. It feels like I’m screaming for someone to come and save me from all of this. Why doesn’t anything help? 


Yes, I have seen both a therapist and psychologist. Neither helped. I am the most fortunate person in the world to have an incredible group of friends. They all want to see me better. They all want to see me happy and smiling. They are all trying so hard to make me feel better. Nothing helps. I’m sorry. I wish it would help. All the little Christmas gifts and heartfelt letters, I wish those things snapped me out of it, but nothing helps. 


My brothers. N, you know I am in pain. The way you look at me, I can tell that you know what is going on inside my head. You tell me jokes all the time in hopes that they make me laugh. I’m sorry. None of those laughs were genuine. P, you give some really great life lessons. You praise me all the time for my grades and work ethic. I don’t think I’ll get as far in life as you think I will. I am sorry for disappointing you.


My dad. The most patient man in the world. You make yourself look like a fool just to make me laugh. You go out and buy my favorite things to make me feel better. I can tell that you’ve run out of things to do. You’ve been watching me suffer, and I’m sorry that none of those things worked. I don’t deserve you. You deserve a daughter that treats you well. I’m sorry for lashing out at you all the time. 


It pains me to see everyone trying so hard to make me feel better. I’m trying, I’ve done everything I can. I just can’t see the vibrancy in anything anymore. It’s all so plain and empty.

Thoughts at 1:20 Am,"I'm sitting here, attempting to write an essay for a class that I don't care about, so I can apply to grad school, and continue to writing essays for classes I don't care about. Where is the logic in that? Especially because we're all just marching along until death.

And then, on Christmas, I got a reminder of every bit of fear and self-hatred I grew up with. My family is fundamentalist Christian, and the fire-and-brimstone teachings sunk their claws into me deep. The fear of hell has kept me here for so long.... And I heard my father talking to my cousin on Christmas, about how he believes that when people die, and go to Heaven, they'll be able to look down on people in Hell, including their own loved ones, and be glad that they are burning. They'll rejoice that the non-believers and sinners are in eternal torment. And if he's right, I'll be one of those people. I'll burn, and he'll rejoice. So will my mother, so will my sister.

And beside that, he also believes that there is nothing anyone can do about it. Free will is a lie. We're destined for our eternal fates, and some of us simply exist to make salvation all the more glorious for those who are lucky enough to experience it.

Why am I here? Why am I struggling to write this essay? It won't save me, it won't bring me any joy. I'm circling a drain.

"Researching and planning for the first time, that is wat scares me","Dealing since a young age with PTSS, Complex Anxiety Disorder, Depression, Somatoform Disorder and some other kinds of mental issues. Tried all kinds of stuff to fix it. For years now, I do not drink alchol, I do not smoke, I don't use drugs, I am a very healthy eater. Battling this disease with everything I have got. Got sick a lot when I was in high school (Henoch Schönlein), before and after that every six weeks I had some kind of illness due to the strong connection between my mind and body, hence the Somatoform Disorder. Later Crohns Disease. Then I started taking supplements and saw a alternative health practisioner and got better. Tried to graduate, but failed due to my symptoms. Climbed the ladder in another field when I quit university and got my dreamjob and had to quit that too due to my symptoms.

&#x200B;

Three years ago I lost my mother, she was my everything. I could handle it because I had found the love of my life and she pulled me through. But despite all the efford I put in everyday to make myself a better man, the symptoms stayed. I used some meds and did some therapy, but never dared to do the right therapywork that had to be done because I was too scared to let all the monsters out of the closet. Made the world of my beautiful wife smaller by letting my anxiety and panick run wild. We were blessed with a beautiful baby. When I saw this little one I felt this huge sudden urge to return to the place where I had my roots, which I always had in a milder version since our stay together. Me and my wife discussed it and it was in the cards, but I was becoming obsessed with this idea. 

&#x200B;

The return fell trough and I let my anxiety and panick run wild again and pushed my wife away by doing so, because I started hitting myself out of frustration that I could not be the man for myself or for her, to bring her to the city we had been talking about. That I had been talking about, I think in the end I neglected her wishes and did not listen enough to her wishes because I was riddled with frustration about my symptoms, which took so much from me despite trying so hard. No, I know it was not the way of trying that my wife hoped for. I tried to start a new job but almost directly my symptoms started flaring up and I had to quit. After this, I hit myself again despite promising my wife to never do it again. At that moment I was frustrated and angry with myself at a level I had never reached before, because so much had happened in the months leading up to that moment (including a 6 week stay at the hospital, which made a huge impact on me). My wife told me she could not go on like this. She can not be a couple anymore and we got divorced. I lost the most precious thing I had, I lost the two most beautiful persons I knew. I returned to the city where I have my roots, but would trade it in the blink of an eye to be with them in another part of the country. I lost it all because I was too anxious to get the right help. I was so busy with surviving all these years and pointing my fingers at different things in these last years, making them the head problems when it wasn't, that I allowed my panick and anxiety to lose it all once more. And I will not get the chance to make it right, because my wife can not do it anymore.

&#x200B;

So here I am. So often I have let my anxiety and panick get the better of me, but this blow strikes the hardest I have ever felt. I thought about suicide earlier, but never got past the stage where I just ran off and called someone in despair. But now, it is different. I have been researching and planning for weeks how to do it safely and that scares me. Because I am a very meticulous person and I know I will go through with this, once the planning is done, because I have nothing to lose anymore. Losing my mother was devastating, this leaves me not wanting to live anymore because I lost everything already. I have agreed with myself to keep researching and planning for a safe and painless suicide for the next weeks in January and after that I am gone.

I just want her to be happy but I can’t even let her show affection to me. I just push her away and tell her to stop bugging me. How can I let someone love me when I hate myself. It just feels like it would be better if I wasn’t here but I’m to scared to act on anything. I just put my .45 to my dome every night and try to bring myself to pull the trigger but I can’t.

So I keep trying to sell myself to live another day.,"I am worthless, I am crap. My life is in shambles, I have no future with love or acceptance in it. I see a Therpist and tell her half truths about my desire to die. Watched a documentary on free diving yesterday. One of the divers had a near death experience, she kept describing it as being at perfect peace and contentment.  That she had to remind herself to live.  I was so jealous that she could be in that place then give up. Why would you do that.  Why would you trade that for a life of loneliness and pain.  I need that peace I need to die and end my pain. As well as the pain I cause others. I have always been a problem, my parents were almost always mad at me for something. My STBX never loved me, used me to fix her problems, take care of her son and then mine.  So she could have fun and do the things she wanted to do. I am have never been wanted, I was put up for adoption when I was born.  My dad always viewed me as just another bad deal he got into.  My kid is a gifted athlete, yet I am unable to help him progress to the level he needs. I do not have to money or connections to help him.  I should just die so they can have my insurance money and live happier lives.  The whole you will be missed thing is bullshit.  I would be missed for all of 10 min, then  their lives would go on and be happy. 

I have written letters to my STBX, my sisters and best friend. I have paid my bills, made it through Christmas. My kid is in Chicago playing hockey he will not know until he comes back. My STBX is busy with her niece visiting so she will be to busy to notice. My best friend is in Hawaii, so the timing is good.   There it nothing to hold me back, I have my 20 gage with a shell in my room and an empty lot across from my condo. It is dark and no one will see or care.  I am out of reasons to sell myself on another day.... I have failed as a man, a husband, and father.... 

Why the f*** am I still breathing, why is god punishing me by making me continue to live.. why can I just not die and be at peace.  ",doneat52,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aa7eim/so_i_keep_trying_to_sell_myself_to_live_another/,12/28/2018/05:33:46,aa7eim,SuicideWatch
"Dysphoric and Depressed, Venting","I've not been like this in a long time. I look at myself in the mirror and all I feel is disgust. This is not my body. And if it is, then I am not destined to keep it long. 
I have no ovaries, no womb to carry a child. 
I have no breasts, and what small estrogen induced lumps remain plastered to my chest are misshapen reminders of that wretched fact. I am not a real woman. I barely feel like a real person. These are the thoughts I bear like weights around my neck. When I wake in the morning and take my pills I long for a hand full of barbiturates, if only the world would be so kind. Of course overdosing is unreliable, and it didnt work for either of my parents so I dont see why it would for me. Driving to work every morning I dream of how easily I could veer off the road. At a high enough speed I could die on impact, but the likelihood of a successful suicide doing so is low. When I arrive to work, I look to the grey panel that sits tucked in a recess in the ceiling of the stairwell. Its only a 3 story building, but we have high ceilings. I can only hope the building would total higher than the average 5 story, or if while I fall I don't impact the concrete skull first, there remains a chance of survival. 
The same thoughts echo in the back of my mind as I sit in silence at my desk slowly realizing that I will likely never have a career I love. I will likely never make enough to live comfortably. What dreams and aspirations I do have, I am either too weak or lacking in discipline to execute. And again I ask myself why I am still alive. And when the answer surfaces, my boyfriend, my bird, I can't help but feel that both would lead happier lives in the hands of another. I get home at night, and wonder if perhaps there is rope in the garage. I've stared up into the beams of its roof, and determined that they could easily hold my weight. Hanging however is one of the least successful methods of suicide and can go wrong in many long, slow and painful ways. When living at my old apartment, there was a night that I ran a bath, littered with dried rose petals and mixed with salts to soothe my muscles. I settled in, the room lit only by candles, with a razor blade in one hand, and a bottle of booze in the other. I figured I could pop a couple of blood thinners, get drunk to the point of delirium and slit my wrists in a tub filled with warm water so that as conciousness began to fade, any straggling shreads of life could be drowned beneath the water's surface. I was not successful. The only wounds I managed to inflict were merely further superficial lacerations to my upper thigh. From there I graduated to a shotgun. My boyfriend's father keeps guns in a safe in the basement. Ammunition and everything at my finger tips. When I first moved in, my boyfriend told me he kept a shotgun under the mattress, and for days I could see nothing but myself, a shotgun balanced with the cold metal circle of the barrel against my forehead, and the butt of the gun braced against a tree. I would reach forward, pull the trigger and in an instant I would be free of this form. My biggest fear, and perhaps the soul reason I have not yet successfully offed myself, is my ever growing fear that the suffering will follow me. If there is an after life of any kind, and if at any point this cursed consciousness within me carries on existing will I still have the chance to find contentment? Or will I relegated to wallow in the waters of my depression for as long as I may remain?
This is not a suicide note. I've written plenty and wouldnt post this if I didnt want to live, in at least some small way. I just need to get this off my chest. Thank you for your time.

I don't want to kill myself,"At times it might feel like I do, but I don't. I know I have so much more to do here. I know I have people here for which my death would deeply wound. I have more than many on this subreddit can say.

But that doesn't change things. That doesn't change how poisoned my mind feels. It doesn't change the fact that I dread the evenings lately, when my mind seems to drop into the lull, and when I start looking through this subreddit trying to justify the thought of killing myself.

I guess at the end of the day I'm just too damn scared. Some call it bravery to keep going, others say it's cowardice. But none of us know what's on the either side, which is the ultimate factor in all of this.

I work one day this next week, and then I'll be starting college. I've been trying so hard to work myself up, tell myself that this final two year push is all I need if I work hard enough. But I don't know. It's all too uncertain, and the alternative would be just so damn easy in concept.

"The universe doesn't care, why should I?","The universe is an unfeeling, and indifferent place. Tomorrow I could get hit by a car and die, I could have a heart attack, I could kill myself, I could maybe live another 50 years, 80 tops. 

No matter what I say, no matter what I do, no matter what I think, I will die.

No matter what I do, it won't matter; if I take my life, some people might hurt for a while, some will eventually hate me or become indifferent to me, but it doesn't matter, I am dead, and they will be too, shortly. Maybe they'll survive 50 year, maybe they will die tomorrow, but they will all die.

People avoid me because I am too much of a burden. My ex-wife divorced me because I was too much of a burden. Even when I try therapy, people find that I am a burden.

Everyone at school hated me growing up; at work, people only tolerate me because of my technical expertise.

My grand father, who is also my namesake, died because he believed he could walk on water while he was still a young adult.

Maybe he understood it all, maybe he understood that life is meaningless and to take one's own life makes no difference. Or maybe he truly believed he could walk on water; maybe he was just mentally ill because some of the molecules in his body were in the wrong place. I don't know, I'll never know because he is gone. He no longer exists and remains but a weak memory in my father's mind and in my grandmother's mind. But those memories will be gone soon as death will come for them, as death will come for me.

What's the point of even trying to live if everything I do will not matter and will be forgotten ? At any moment, a blood vessel killing me in minutes, I could drown trying to walk on water, I commit suicide because the wrong amount of serotonine and dopamine was produced in my head, I could get in a fatal car accident because 1/100th of a second I was not paying attention and I lose control of my vehicule, I could walk and get hit by a car, I could die of any number of diseases that exist. I could die because any one of the billions of cells in my body suddenly decides to replicate itself out of control. There could be a misfolded protein floating in my blood that could reach the wrong part of my brain tomorrow morning and I could be dead within weeks. There is an infinite number of ways for me to die, and no way for me to live. Any attempt at living will only prolong my inevitable death.

And when I die, and no matter how I die, people will be temporarily inconvenienced for a short time before they too eventually die, and I'll be lost forever just a statistic on a graph that will be lost in 100 years.

Friends, psychologists, psychiatrists, doctors, family, suicide hotlines, they all pretend that things can get better, that I can live. But I can't live, death is coming. And it may be lurking around the next corner, or it might be down the street, it might be growing inside of me and I don't even know.

So why should I actively work to prolong a meaningless life on a meaningless rock floating in a meaningless galaxy ? Why should I try and live another 30-80 years if I will eventually die anyways ?

I've tried making friends, talking to family ( I feel more and more of a burden to them ), I've spoken with counsellors, psychologists, psychiatrists, suicide hotlines, therapy groups, but they can't help, they pretend that there is meaning where there is none, they pretend there is worth when there is none.

They say that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. They are right, life is temporary and death is permanent. But I will die, that is certain.

But most of all, somehow they think that it is my choice that the universe is indifferent and meaningless. They think I can chose whether my life has meaning or not, but there is only one choice: do I go out on my terms or do I live in fear that when death comes it will be slow and painful ?

I need to hide my depression and suicidal thoughts from everyone I know,"I recently made the mistake of telling my boyfriend I was depressed and possibly suicidal and the result was him feeling really shitty because he couldn't help and threatening to call helplines and hospital to get me to rehab.

 I can't afford therapy and I don't want my family to know about it because depression is considered something to be ashamed of where I am from. I'm terrified of being hospitalised too bc I'm afraid they will put me amongst clinically insane people and I don't want to get hurt.

Any of you get suicidal thoughts out of nowhere?,"Just wanted to ask before I go to sleep.

Over the past few years, there's been a lot of changes in my family that I'm still not used to. Everybody has moved on but I haven't. I've been told that I should do the same but I can't. I'm still angry at certain family member because they're the cause of the biggest change. I'm confused and upset by all this which is making hard to get passed it. When somebody does something that affects the entire family and you, its clear that getting over it isn't an option. Why do people act the way they do?

I've been like this since 2015. Before then, I've never had thoughts of suicide and cutting. I never thought that I'd start hitting my arms because I can't hit someone else. I didn't think that I would have to debate whether or not I should off myself.

Every now and then a suicidal thought will come out of nowhere and linger in my head for a long time. Same thing with cutting myself. I think about cutting even though I haven't done it. When I get these thoughts I wonder if I should live. Recently, I thought about not eating but that has to do with something else.

Do this happen to you? Sudden thoughts of suicide or harming? I could be happy then I'll abruptly think about suicide and it'll bring down the mood. I'm not sure why this happens but I'm positive that other people experience this. Could my mind be telling me that I'm not good enough? I don't know if I want to end things or cut.

My parents always try to act super understanding, which makes me just feel pathetic, since i used to have really good grades until i was maybe 12, now i am basically crawling through every year. I am taking sleep medicine recreatively for almost 3 months already, and i just got estranged with my best friend and my crush. Things are getting better, since i got vacation, but now it is just one month of boredom until the next sledgehammer of an year that 2019 will be. I don't really have anything to talk about with my parents or with a therapist, since apparently i am getting better (according to my parents). rn the only thing stopping me is that i need to feed my pet tomorrow, but if my pet dies (it shows signs of pneumonia) i am going to end it. My wall of text isn't coherent, but it sure is hollow.",MyDongHurtsSoMuch,4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aa6kci/i_have_no_reason_to_live_and_no_reason_to_die/,12/28/2018/03:41:35,aa6kci,SuicideWatch
"I just cut myself, but I didn’t hang myself.","I probably still will. Or tape a bag around my head. I haven’t decided yet. Mostly, I’m just pathetic. I waited for thirty minutes for a counselor on a suicide prevention chat. I cut myself while I waited. After a while, I just got tired of waiting. I don’t want to talk to someone on the phone. I’ll cry, and I do enough crying as it is. That gets me nowhere. It’s helpful to see something in writing. To be able to remember objective text and remind myself later like a mantra. 

After half an hour, the number of people in line in front of me was still 12. It hadn’t changed. That’s at least six hours of waiting. I decided not to do it in the next six hours. That’s eight cuts later. 

I dunno, guys. I’m just running out of reasons to keep going. They’re all the same reasons and they’re all still there but less real. Hopefully I’ll wake up tomorrow and things will feel different, but that hope is getting harder to hold onto because usually it’s exactly the same. 

There are people that love me. But I couldn’t call any of them. Really, I’m lucky to have so many loved ones. There’s nothing they can do. I don’t want to trouble them now, because they’ll blame themselves when I eventually do it. And because I won’t have loved ones anymore if I keep reaching out to them. They have their own lives, their own problems. They won’t want to deal with my bullshit indefinitely. It will ultimately be easier for them if I just don’t say anything about it. 

I’d rather my loved ones be angry with me for keeping this to myself than blame themselves for not being able to do more. 

I’m so tired of being sad. I’m so tired of not being enough. I’m so tired of fighting against who I am, of faking it all the time, of being the needy friend/family member. I don’t have it in me to pretend to be okay or to try to succeed. It’s exhausting and I’m broken. I just can’t anymore.

I Wish Someone Would Kill Me,"I wish someone would kill me because I am too much of a pansy to do it myself. Like I just want to die, but I can't bring myself to do it. The reason why is probably pretty silly, my life is actually pretty good but I have a complete lack of any meaningful, lasting relationships or friendships. Eventually everyone leaves me and they refuse to tell me what I did or even talk to me. I've gone through about six emotionally empty sexual relationships with women who didn't care about me in the last year. I don't know what I am doing wrong but lacking friends or an SO for so many years completely sucks. It is like I don't understand what other people want or need from me, I can't figure it out.

Should I tell my husband that his brother is suicidal?,"I'm 20, my husband is 22, and his brother is 25. His brother left his home state with his 3 yr old child to our home after he split with his wife. He's always been suicidal and threatens to kill himself. Well it happened at my house now. He left to work walking <his job is 50 miles away> and it's cold outside. He messaged me saying he was suicidal and that hes a burden. He also said he isnt coming back until tomorrow. His wife that he supposedly separated  from messaged me saying hes been threatening to kill himself and talking crazy. I find it crazy because we've done so much for him. We've paid for everything for 4 months when he was living here and paid for his sons diapers and wipes when we need to do the same for my daughter. I make home made meals for him and I washed his dishes. I even drove him to work at 5 am and picked him up afterwards and not pay for gas. We've done so much for him and I feel dumb. Idk if hes acting this way because I told him he needs to get a car by jan 3 and to start washing his own dishes. Btw hes been here for 10 months. Idk now if I should tell my husband because I told my brother in law that i wouldnt tell my husband.... sounds obvious what I should do but I need advice to know I'm going to do the right thing or if I'm going to break his trust.

But, I've apparently managed to only surround myself with people who just don't care. My husband who used to love and adore me, just works and plays games. (He's a professor!)  I have multiple degrees and have all my loans paid off. I should be happy. Should.  I bent over backwards raising my daughter who came about from date rape.  She's recently turned on me slamming me to friends and social media every chance she gets.  I thought I raised her better but clearly I didn't.
My mother calls me a bad parent because I'm not ridiculously overprotective of my daughter.  She also thinks I'm negligent because I spent years in college instead of sitting at home on welfare.
I've turned into a bank for my family.  ""Lend me this, lend me that!"" I support my mother. I bought her a new car, make her house payments which is fine.  I'm the first real success in my family and I am happy to help. But in the end when I need an ear, I get nothing. Nobody contacts me except for money or legal advice.  Nobody asks how I am. Nobody cares.
I read that suicide is a permanent fix to a temporary problem. I disagree. My problem is my life. I don't want it. And allegedly suicide is selfish. How? Nobody cares. When I say this I'm told, ""People love you!"".... Who?........  *crickets*  Fact is not all of us have people who care about us. Some of us care about people who care about our money.

I’m done.,"I feel so done with life. I don’t think that I want to live to see another year of life. The thought that I probably have at least another sixty years (I’ll be almost seventy-six) left in my life makes me sad.  I don’t think that I want to live to see 2019.

I donmt know how to do anything.

He’s a nice person but he’s so condescending that he makes me not even want to be around him. He’s so condescending and annoying that it’s hard for me to even bring myself to feel sympathy for him. My dad said earlier today (referencing his friend’s death) that life is short. Sometimes I feel like life isn’t short enough and it can’t end fast enough. I hate life.

• Should I continue my life or end it?
• If I decide to end it, what should I spend the days or weeks leading up to it doing?
• What are some things that I should do before I do it?

It’s no longer me who wants to die,"I suffered depression for a long time and after my failed suicide attempt, i led a very quiet life for many, many years with little friends, worked a low-paying but very secure job and spent my time reading and watching tv only. 

I finally had the opportunity to return to school, courtesy of the company I worked with and met my current husband. He was like sunshine, gave me confidence, full of energy and showed me how to live my life. I enjoyed many firsts like travelling, fine dining, movies, etc. 

Fast forward to now, we are married with kids, he’s enjoyed multiple successes at work. On the other hand, I lost my job after birth, and haven’t managed to find my way back to corporate life since. 

I do have an issue with my self esteem but I don’t think I’m suffering from depression? What makes me think I’m down in the pits is discovering that my husband has become the depressed one instead. His feeling of self-worth has plummeted and he’s began to have suicidal thoughts. Sometimes they come at him so intensely, that he’s already researched and decided which way he wants to die. 

I honestly do not know how I can carry on living without him because I depended on him so much emotionally. 

We recently went through therapy together and talks about his childhood (he was abused for many years and neglected) surfaced. This led to even more negative feelings because images of him being beaten, belittled, humiliated replayed over and over. 

I do not know how to manage this. He is apprehensive about checking himself into emergency because he’s afraid of his company ever finds out he will lose his job. 

He is not on any medication yet and he doesn’t know whether to start because he’s pending to see a cardiologist as well. 

I’m very thankful he’s gone to seek help, but the help is coming really slowly. What else can I do? I’m scared and I don’t have family members to confide in, I’m not sure if I want to tell any friends. 

So many what ifs going through my head now. Some days I feel like my own life has just fallen apart - from coming out of my darkness only to see my Husband crumbling like that. 

Some days I feel like escaping this journey by dying first? But who will look after my babies? ",Islandgirlnowhere,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aa5bqt/its_no_longer_me_who_wants_to_die/,12/28/2018/01:05:16,aa5bqt,SuicideWatch

would appreciate a brief list of things to do before moving forward.

and about suicide notes... is it mandatory to leave one? or if your life's been 29 years of lows, people are able to piece things together and add it up, no?

thanks in advance and don't bother pleading- it's far past that. 

p.s. i'm sure it gets asked a lot... but what's the quickest and easiest way? i'm unable to get a gun, so focus on other options please.

p.s.s. does it perhaps make sense to sell off all of my belongings and leave whatever cash is left over after funeral expenses to a loved one? i think that might be best, rather than have them have to worry about figuring out what belongs in what box and how much what's worth.",yyz89,5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aa57wb/how_to_make_it_as_easy_as_possible_from_a/,12/28/2018/00:52:27,aa57wb,SuicideWatch
forgetting or ignoring reality?,"(Background: mentally ill, stuck in a miserable, loveless marriage that we are both too pussy assed to leave, lost a lot of weight but still very obese, covered in hanging skin (and things will get even more loose and wrinkly and more horrific as time goes on, yes I know about surgery but I also know about my bank account balance lmao), no friends, a few work acquaintances, not sure I can maintain friendships, eating disorder, lifelong depression and anxiety, about to turn 30, spend most of my time at home crying, constantly sad, forgetful, low energy, irritable, no good qualities as a person even when not mentally ill blah blah blah just trying to pre-empt the ""someone out there loves you"" comments)

&#x200B;

Does anyone ever feel like whenever they don't feel suicidal for a short period of time, it's a trick? Like whenever I don't feel like dying, it's usually when I've forgotten my life circumstances. I had about 12 hours where I wasn't happy but was like ""Eh may as well stick around, got nothing else to do"". Then I read the askmen thread on the front page about when women's bodies turned them off, saw several posts about loose skin from weight loss and people being grossed out or joking and remembered ""oooh right that's why I wanna get outta here"". That's just the most recent example, just using today to illustrate a point. There's no hope for the future. People say it's a permanent solution for a temporary problem but my problems aren't temporary. They're inherent to me.

&#x200B;

Like even if therapy and yoga meditation and meds could make my brain better and I could be so happy and love myself, my actual reality would still suck. I can't love myself into being a worthwhile person and depression meds won't conjure up loved ones for me or make me not a physical freak. I feel like it's all kind of bullshit to try to fix my depression because me not wanting to die is just me ignoring my reality. At least, that's my experience.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I guess it also depresses and frustrates me that I can't kill myself because I do know that people would be upset (ie my mom who I don't really like and who abused me physically and emotionally as a child) and that I cannot leave a gross ass dead body for some poor person to find, even a trained professional would be upset.

I feel like all my struggles are childish and often think of cutting myself and how worthless i am and shit y'all know,"So i know this girl, we're friends, i often videochat with her but i don't really feel like it's important to her to talk to ME. I feel like she just kinda wants to talk to someone, because she likes video chatting or something, i don't know.
I really like her a lot, but I'm scared to tell her, because she doesn't really seem to be interested in me. She's also taller than me. I'm pretty small and because of that my self confidence is like really fucking low. I'm really sensitive, so even if i'm like playing some fucking video games with friends and someone is raging because of something in the game and tells me mean stuff, clearly as some sort of a joke I get like really fucking sad. Even tho I'm trying not to show it.
My sister has a boyfriend who she lives with. She attends a university like 1 hour away from our house. She's 19, he's in his 20s. He failed at the university, doesn't work, has no money and often screams at my sister and does like really fucked up shit. But she's blind and really loves him idk.
My parents had a lot of fights with her because of her sick boyfriend. Even at the time while she didn't attend university, she wasn't at home a lot. She was at her boyfriends home and my parents had a lot of fights with her because of that. I feel so sad and angry, but i can't do anything. I kinda lost my sister, she's more or less gone, living with that fucking dickhead and my parents always argue with her and i feel like there's a lot of tension.
I got in touch with a girl on the internet a while ago who had struggles with depression and i tried to help her. Sheblocked me one day for no reason and her best friend told me, that she didn't need my help. I think she even cut herself because of me. She unblocked me a few months ago and apologized, but i still don't feel good.
Another old friend of mine just kinda blocked my contact with her the last time that i texted her. It was 2am, i saw that she was online and i asked her, why she was still awake. She immedeatly went offline and ignored me for an hour. I went to sleep. The next day i saw her message, and texted a little with her and asked her why she didn't reply. She told me, that she didn't want to text with me. I know i should resoect that or something like that but it hurt like a lot
I don't know, i feel like i'm really fucking ugly, my voice sounds like some dude scratched a chalkboard with nails or however the fuck you say that in english, i just feel like my friends do stuff with me because they feel pity or some shit. Nobodys real. I don't feel like i can talk to anyone about my feelings. And i feel like everything i worry about is childish.
Fuck it. At daytime everythings more or less okay but at night i wanna fucking die

"Been wanting to die since age 8. Now 26, hopefully never 27.","As the title says, I've been seriously thinking about dying since I was 8. The depression only got worse over the years. I've been given a shitty hand in life, involving abuse in different forms and terrible mental health problems as a result. I've done all I could to get better. Therapy, medications, healthy lifestyle, and that for so many years. I'm still in therapy and on meds but I'm incapable of living a normal life. I can't live by myself, I am on disability payment which is only $350, so I couldn't leave my toxic parents even if I tried. I'm very unstable, going from numb to intense rage that has me punching walls, or getting carried away with selfharming and crying and whatnot. And those emotions can change within seconds. I'm unable to for personal relationship, neither romantic or sexual. I have phobias, insecurities etc. Every part of my body and personality is damaged in some way. What I have is not a life. I have nothing. I am nothing. The only reason I'm here is because I don't want my mother to have to live with the trauma of having a daughter killing herself. Once she dies (natural or accidental), I can finally bleed out and do what I've wanted to do for 18 years. Being happy.

It's getting harder and harder to hold myself back from doing it anyway, mother or not. I feel like I'm so close to giving up. I don't know how to hold on anymore. Why can't I just let myself be selfish for once? I don't want to live this life anymore. I don't want to be me. I'm sorry for this ranting, I'm not doing well right now.",ReptileFreaky,4,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aa4mr1/been_wanting_to_die_since_age_8_now_26_hopefully/,12/27/2018/23:43:43,aa4mr1,SuicideWatch
Tonight’s the night.,"I really have been made to feel like I’m a fucking terrible person who deserved everything they get and deserve to get treated like whatever. 

I can’t fucking believe I’ve stayed in this shitty abusive relationship for this long. This fucking asshole that I have the complete and utter HONOUR of calling me boyfriend is so mentally and emotionally abusive and manipulates me so much. He does something to hurt me almost everyday. Almost everyday for a year and a fucking half. I’ve had enough now. 

What’s really pushed it this time is when he came back 6 or so months ago from work with love bites on his next and I believed his shitty excuse then he planned a trip to stay in the middle of the red night district in Amsterdam behind my back and ignored me the whole time and stayed an extra night without obviously letting me fucking know and I was devastated thinking his plane crashed... like I wasn’t devastated in the first place. 

He promised me nothing like that would happen again because of how much he hurt me and a month ago he told me he’s going to a place a ten hour drive away with his friends and said he really wanted me to come and he couldn’t go without me. So last night I stayed at his house so we could leave together and he decided he’s now getting the car with his friends and tried to walk out his own house on me and leave me an hour away from home at 2 in the fucking morning minutes away from where my kidnapper lives who kidnapped me last week and he’s not in fucking prison. 

I got in his friends car crying begging him don’t leave me here don’t do this to me again and he dragged me out across the road and pinned me down and tried to get his friend to floor his car on me and ran off from me and obviously I ran after him given it being 2 am and my kidnapper lives up the fucking road and he starts mocking me while I almost have an asthma attack. He phoned his friend while I was in bits crying saying he was going to run off and leave me and meet them to get picked up. And he fucking did. I ran into the direct across the road and he fucking left me. Claims he loves me and just abuses me verbally and emotionally and does this bullshit. I’ve had enough. Nothings going right and this has pushed me over the fucking edge. Imagine your boyfriend or girlfriend trying to get you ran over and leaving you when they said they wouldn’t ar 2 am in the streets dragging you across the road onto a field thing and running off to maybe get fucking kidnapped again. What. The. Fuck.",anonuserplus1997,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aa4lc4/tonights_the_night/,12/27/2018/23:39:11,aa4lc4,SuicideWatch

Dont ever want to smile again,"Despite how much i struggle i try to smile at people but get nothing in return. Its just compulsion at this point. It also just feels so false and disingenuous. Everyone always says to me just smile and people will smile back ""try it, itll brighten your day"". But i literally just get glared or scouled at. Cant remember the last time someone smiled back. Dont see any good in anyone anymore. I want to be able to walk past people without feeling this compulsion or false sense of empathy which cant be anything but projection. I would love to be invisible and never seen by anyone ever again. Iv gotten used to the loneliness. All thats left is just to dissapear",anondescriptUn,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aa4fpx/dont_ever_want_to_smile_again/,12/27/2018/23:21:28,aa4fpx,SuicideWatch
Life is like a lit street...,"This is the way I've seen life for a while now.... 

It's like a street. There are lamp posts lining the road. Each has their own light. Sometimes those lights go out. Wether it be because they were old and just burnt out or were defective and burnt out before they were supposed to. There's a person who has to go and change those lights when they burn out. They go and switch out the old ones that burn out but sometimes lights just break. He's got to go and change those lights and sure it might be frustrating having to change out the lightbulbs that went out before they were supposed to but it happens. 

We all have our own light. Sometimes we just break and the people around us have to dispose of the bodies and continue on, looking for another light to replace it with. There are so many lights if just one burns out it doesn't effect anything except the very small group of people around us. Outside of that group we don't exist. And why should we? Everyone else is too far for that light to reach. Everyone moves on from pain and if they don't then they suffer and start to dim till they burn out. It's a cycle. We burn out and get replaced and sometimes lights just break. 

I'm 16. I'm only alive because I promised her I wouldn't end it. I promised her if I plan on attempting again I would warn her. This girl is my ex. She's the only person on this planet I truly care about. She will blame herself if I kill myself. I can't let that happen. Another girl will also blame herself. Those two girls would be destroyed. They would both end it. If those two girls end it. Then both of their boyfriends will. That's 4 suicides not counting me. Do you realize how many fucking families that is. How many people that involves. What about the parents of those people. My ex's dad could lose it. He's already lost his wife to suicide. And the other girls Mom could lose it as well. And what about my ex's boyfriend. His grandma could lose it. She's already got 4 different cancers. The suicide of her grandson could finally finish her. Then that brings us to her granddaughter. She would be losing her cousin and one of her friends (me) she would be devastated. What about my mom. She's attempted before when she was younger and still on tons of meds for issues. That would destroy my dad. Losing his closest son and wife. I can keep going but you get my point. 

The point of this post was to take out my pain somewhere else but I got distracted and accidentally talked myself out of suicide. ",Panda_Penguin,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aa4f68/life_is_like_a_lit_street/,12/27/2018/23:19:44,aa4f68,SuicideWatch
The dead don't hurt,"Death might hurt. I mean, my plans include freezing to death as my first choice. I want to die in Lake Ontario in a cute little nook near my house where a willow tree hangs over the water. It'll be peaceful and serene... and fucking cold as fuck. But the pain of death is temporary.

My other choices are equally as dramatic and painful: I might take sleeping pills and set my barn on fire, or I might take one of the syringes out of the veterinary cupboard and inject air into my vein, or maybe hang myself in the barn (okay, I'm just realizing how much the barn factors into these plans!)... none of them is painless but what does that matter in the end? Also, like, let's be honest here... life is fucking pain.

Yeah, it's a different kind of pain. Emotional pain, but pain nonetheless. The dead don't hurt... physically or emotionally.",MadHacktress,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aa4d9m/the_dead_dont_hurt/,12/27/2018/23:13:24,aa4d9m,SuicideWatch
