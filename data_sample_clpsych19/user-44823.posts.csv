e5db6,-44823,1289604263,Minecraft,I wrote an app to help record Minecraft for Youtube.,"I recorded a video of my cactus farm last night for Reddit and only after it was fully uploaded did I realize it wouldn't generate a 720p video. I use fraps at 1900x1200 but half the resolution for recording as 1080p would be huge and take a ton of I/O. The only solution is to run the window at 720p or change my resolution. I wrote an app to help with the former. It's written in VB 6.0 (.. I know.. I know) and it's pretty dirty. It gives a full list of windows, lets you pick one and adjust exactly the dimensions of it then re-size it. I couldn't find anything like this out there already so I was wondering if there would be interest? If I post it I'll include the source code and clean it up a bit.Any budding Minecraft video makers see this as useful?**Edit:** So I've switched over to using Perl. It's much more transportable as I can compile it without requiring runtime files.  Hell the code was even easier to write. :P_URL_ (source)"

f8x15,-44823,1295987897,techsupport,One of the strangest computer repairs I've done.,"So here's the setup. Last Saturday my computer wouldn't boot up. Self-built Core 2 Duo E8500 stock clock and a Gigabyte Motherboard in a CM HAF 932. Power button didn't do anything. Tried all the standard non-invasive things to troubleshoot and nothing.I unplugged everything and took it to the kitchen table . Tried shorting the power switch pins manually in case it was a bad power button and that didn't work either. Went and bought a new power supply and replaced the power connectors to the motherboard with the new supply. Still nothing. Guess it's something more serious. Time for an upgrade! :DWent and got a new ASUS P8P67, i5 2500k, and 8 gigs of DDR3. Put it all together in my case, hit the power and it started up. Ahh, bad motherboard and/or cpu I guess? Anyhow I plugged everything in, closed it up and installed it under my desk. It was, however, not an happily ever after story.On the first bootup I got a message about USB overload and was told that the system would shut down in 15 seconds. I started unplugging usb devices one at a time to pinpoint which one was acting up. Finally it was just the keyboard and still with the message. Unplugged it and... still USB overload....Then I had a flashback to Saturday. I accidentally stepped on my iphone data cable and heard something snap. I saw a bit of black plastic on the carpet but figured I had snapped it off the bottom of the case. Nope, that was from one of the front USB connectors. I took a loser look and part of it had collapsed which was obviously shorting out the usb port. Once I unplugged the cable connecting that header to the MB, everything was fine.I've been working on computer for 25+ years and this is definitely in the top 3 of strange and hard to diagnose issues. Now I've got my old motherboard here sitting at work so I can test it out. Hopefully it's fine so I can sell it. (E8500 -&gt; i5 2500k is quite a nice jump, not returning anything). [](/solved)"

Awesome italian sausge, piled high with peppers, onions, mushrooms and marinara. I'm no longer dating the girl who's family lives there so I've got no excuse to head up that way again.  There's got to be somewhere a bit closer to the south bay that can sate my desire for delicious heartburn! Any suggestions?"

A quick and dirty hackjob but it's really made my mythtv experience a lot more enjoyable so I thought I'd share. The HDHomerun tuner has the ability to detect which channels are available and what you're subscribed to. This script will use this functionality to turn off the visibility of channels you don't have access to.Steps to use:  0) Back up your database or be prepared to re-enable all channels.  1) Visit your HDHomerun device on your network via this url:  _URL_  2) Click ""Detect Channels""  3) Once it's finished, download and modify this script:_URL_  Be sure to update your database information as well as the ip address for your hdhomerun device in the $url variable.  4) Have you backed up your database? It couldn't hurt!  5) Run this script. The output will tell you which channels it's making invisible as it runs.  6) If you're using XBMC, make sure to go to Settings -&gt; Live TV -&gt; General -&gt; Reset PVR Database. Also make sure Always use the channel order from the backend and Use backend channel numbers are checked."
