26u0eb,10146,1401408839,dating,Am I doing something wrong?,"As the title says, I have no clue what I'm doing in the dating world. There's no real preference to the girls I do approach, but for the successes I do have , it *seems* like I move too fast and ruin something down the line. Before you say that that's my problem, I've tried to read up on dating advice and even went so far as to shelling out about $200 or so to simplepickup.com for dating advice - don't get me wrong, they helped me have a much better success rate and everything - to no relationship lasting more than a couple weeks before they break up (lol). I'm not complaining or anything either, I just saw that there has been relationship advice that has been given and I was wondering if I was doing anything wrong or not."

I'm a 20 year old who is looking for my ""It Girl"" in life. Basically by that I mean a girl I can be best friends with while being in a relationship with her. I may be too young to some people, plus it may scare some away but that's really okay. I'm quite mature for my age and I'm actually ready for a deeper relationship than many who are in their 20s.      _PERSON_ _PERSON_ described it best when he sang his song.    &gt; You could be my it girl.  &gt; Baby you're the shit girl, loving you should be a crime.  &gt; Crazy how you fit girl  &gt; This is it girl  &gt; Gimme 25 to life            **About me**    * I am quite possibly the tallest Filipino you have seen (6'3"")  * I love all types of music!

As for favorites, 90s or early 00s R&amp;B is my bread and butter.  * My tastes in movies and TV Shows are pretty much the same as music. I don't stick to one particular genre at all. If I watch Netflix, then one moment I can be watching Attack on Titan (I'm a nerd lol) and the next show could be Freaks and Geeks.

27fi22,10146,1402014574,CodAW,"This may have been done to death, but *my thoughts* on what should be in AW","*This will be a long post. I apologize in advance c:*         **League Play**  Black Ops 2 helped out the competitive Call of Duty scene in a way that it allowed normal people to play against other people using the pro rule sets without having to go through GameBattles. Don't have another ""Clan vs Clan"" where it counts towards your Public Match stats either.         **Higher TTK**  Ghosts ALMOST had it right. If the TTK was the same as Black Ops 2 or other CoDs before it, then most people wouldn't bash it as much as they have.         **More dedicated servers**  The Xbox One has about 300,000 servers. With tons of people upgrading to the next gen systems for this next game, please make use of the added servers. It would make it so that people can actually play without too much lag compensation. That and the game would be less connection based.         **Hit Detection**  I love the hit detection in Ghosts... Keep it that way.         **Gun Balance**  Self explanatory. Instead of having 1 or 2 dominant weapons, make it so that you can run around with ALMOST anything and at least have fun with it. Competitive is one thing, there has to be banned items, but in pubs make it more balanced, please.         **""CoD style maps""**   3 main lanes of traffic with buildings and debris thrown in here and there (Not too many though). While you're at it, make it so you don't have to watch every angle at all times when you go into a room. In a map like Sovereign, if you go to the B Flag in Domination, you literally have to watch from everywhere. Caution, nest, divider, research and underground... Not to mention grenades flying everywhere.         **LAN Support**  Self explanatory.         **Scorestreaks not Killstreaks**   Once again, Black Ops 2 had a superior advantage over Ghosts here. People don't have an incentive to play for the objective and you have people camping close to flags instead of capping. If you could implement Specialist in the scorestreak system (i.e. Perk 1 is 500-700 points, Perk 2 650-800, Perk 3 850-1000, Specialist 1000-1500) it would be great.         **Theater Mode**  Ghosts took a huge step backwards with the removal of this.         **C4s and Claymores/Bouncing Betties/IEDs**  I don't mind any of these things personally. But make them less effective. Give them a bit more of a delay before they explode, lessen the damage, do something so people can't rely on these for half of their kills.         **Lock on Launcher**  Please bring back the Stinger or whatever you want to name it. I'm tired of hiding when there's an enemy helicopter.         **No Marksman rifle class**  They're more of a nuisance now.         **Customization**   Once again, Ghosts had this right. The character customization is amazing. But make it so we don't have to spend $4 for a character though...         **Volume Sliders**  I know you worked hard on the soundtrack and the codcaster voice, but please for the love of God let this happen. I play with the sound turned wayyy up in SND and whenever the music comes on or I'm the last alive, I nearly get a heart attack.         **GET RID OF THE AMPLIFY/AWARENESS PERK**  Please. It only serves as a cheap perk.         **MW2 Style unlocking system**  Headshots for camos, kills with attachments to unlock other attachments, NO points. They're literally useless once you reach a high enough prestige and they just add up with nothing to save up for. If you do use points, keep pushing out content that allows you to purchase it with the points instead of currency like 1000 points for a personalization (sp?) pack instead of $1.99. It would keep people playing and you'll potentially sell more Micro DLC if it's cool enough.         **tl;dr**  Bottom Line is that there are alot of ways where you can make this potentially rival Modern Warfare 1 and 2 in the series. To be honest, I would be happy if about half of the above list was implemented. But if you want a game that you'll get minimal backlash for, these are the main issues I see with the games in general. The list can honestly go on and on. You have a built in fanbase - both competitive and casual - of millions of players who are ready and willing to praise Sledgehammer Games for their work on Advanced Warfare. I really do not hope this game ""screws the pooch""."

30u4i4,10146,1427741903,OpTicGaming,[Fluff] The only roster move for ON I can potentially see. My personal thoughts.,"Coming off of an early exit from CoD Champs and surprising many people, a popular opinion around here is that ON will make [yet] another roster change in the coming days/weeks. Now as I see it, Teep has had a couple of bad events, but I think he can shine after he gets Champs behind him. Karma just does what he does. He roams and slays with the best of them. Mir is a great consistent player imo. He can slay while playing the true OBJ and that's a rare trait. The only player I see ON dropping/trading at the moment is _PERSON_ because he can be inconsistent at events. While he did step up this past weekend, he has under performed in the other tournaments slaying wise.       If anything, I see _PERSON_ being dropped/traded for Enable or _PERSON_. ON needs someone who can perform consistently well while being the in game leader. _PERSON_ is an amazing communicator while being great in pretty much every game mode, and then you have one of the OGs of competitive console FPS in Enable. He is the experienced player everyone would love to have, plus throw in the fact that he is a great player and you have someone who can potentially turn ON around.                    If my opinion counts for anything here, I see these two as an upgrade to _PERSON_. Don't get me wrong, I love the guy. He's an extremely smart SnD God and will never have trouble finding a team because he is a great guy as well. But as of now, it would seem that ON doesn't really need him."
