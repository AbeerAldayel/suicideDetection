Let's see what you got Reddit.,"I only ever played the first one that came out for the PSP, and the mechanics of it were such garbage, it turned me off to the series. Now I'm seeing promotion for IV, and it looks intense. So I've decided to buck up and order the 1st one. Got Spring Break coming next week. Let's go Reddit, without spoiling the story for me, get me excited to play this game."

Honestly, it was one of the most gratifying feelings ever, watching the Joker get knocked out and fall from the top of the tower. I watched my brother beat it when I was younger, and never could do it. I picked it up again recently and was determined to finally finish it, regardless of how long it took. I have practiced and practiced and practiced, learning strategy and boss patterns, and it resulted in a 3 hour stint blasting through the game, culminating in the final showdown. It's amazing how games that are over 20 years old and so simple in their mechanics can give you more satisfaction upon completion than most games of the modern age. Anyways, just wanted to share my success (and my happiness) with you all. Thanks :)"
