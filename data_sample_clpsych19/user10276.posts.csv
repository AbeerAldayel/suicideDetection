But they always get worse somehow. College was my hope. A job. A future. Thanks to stupid councellors and those stupid medications I managed to screw up previous semester. I'm on the way to mess up this one too. They'll cancel me financial aid. Or put me on probation. Or just kick me out. I dont like living at home due to aspergers and shit. And I dont have anywhere else to go. I'm thinking about taking my own life this week. But I dont wanna hurt my mom. She wont be able to take it. I have no idea what to do."

v7736,10276,1339978327,aspergers,ASD and multitasking?,"Are People with ASD known to have serious multitasking problems? Because for me it's nearly impossible to do two things at a time or concentrate on multiple things at the same time. For example, unlike most people I can never concentrate on a lecture while taking notes or checking a text message on phone. I seem to lose track of what the instructor was saying very fast. Also, I can't listen to music and solve math questions at the same time. I can't even read an article on the web while listening to music. Similarly, when I'm watching sports on tv and I switch my attention to phone for checking twitter updates, I instantly lose focus of both. I can neither make much sense of tweets nor the match because I'm trying to focus on both. While most people on my twitter timeline or on IRC channels seem to be able to manage this very very well. Likewise, when I'm trying to concentrate on something it's like my other senses have stopped working. If i'm doing something (or even just thinking a random thought) and someone talks to me, I almost always have to ask them to repeat what they just said. How common is this problem?edit: another thing that just came to mind. Inability to focus on both audio and video in movies. Things seem to happen way too fast for me. Hence I always need subtitles while watching movies/tv shows. And if a movie doesn't have subtitles like in cinemas, i come out all confused not having understood most of the storyline for whatever reason.  This might also be because most movies/shows I watch are in english and english is not my native language but I seem to understand it very well. I've probably watched more american tv shows than even most americans. I have read a lot of english books and all. I can read, speak and understand english just fine."

I seem to get tired very easily and need to rest (take an hour long nap e.g) to just get through the day. I started noticing this in high school and the problem has only exacerbated since then. Back in HS, just two/three classes would wear me out physically as well as emotionally and I would spend the rest of the day with moderate to severe headache not concentrating in classes at all. Now that I'm in college, I don't have to take consecutive classes but still whenever I take two classes in a row, I come back to my room and take a long nap. This despite getting at least 7/8 hours of sleep every night. My roommate gets through the day easily and only sleeps at night.Even when I'm not taking classes i.e I have a few days off, I can't study for extended periods of time. It gets harder and harder to focus as time passes. This has been getting in the way of me taking part in various activities and I doubt I'll be able to work long hours when I graduate. I consulted a physician long before I was diagnosed with ASD but he basically came up with nothing. I sought help of college physician too but she blamed this on laziness."

I'm not the kind of person who would take drugs for recreational purpose so this was like the only option I was left with after my anxiety got unbearably bad (to the point of me wanting to take my own life) and I started breaking down almost everyday. Due to my poor past experiences with psychiatrists and financial problems, I don't want to see one and am looking for a solution on my own.  I'm currently taking 2mg/day in the form of two 0.5mg pills in the morning and two in the evening. Is this amt. appropriate? also although i feel it is helping me and I feel better than before, I still feel quite anxious most of the time.

I told him about my anxiety and all but it's unlikely he'll give it much weight.  I'm done with this sh*t. I gave it all. I practised about 20 times. Still came up short. And I have zero motivation to go further. I have another presentation in the morning, tomorrow and I absolutely have zero motivation to prepare for it. This is it. I'm done.

14ojql,10276,1355256575,aspergers,Persistent communication problems,"It's so frustrating not to be able to 'just converse' with people. And not just IRL. On phone too. I've been in an on-again, off-again relationship for a long time and the biggest problem i've faced is to not be able to talk like most people. I just sit quietly in front of her with my head absolutely blank. On phone, i ask her a few cliché questions which she's not interested in talking about, eventually ending up scratching my head trying to figure out what to say. A lot of times, the frustration results in me making a joke she finds offensive or me saying something i regret later. Simple miscommunication has resulted in a lot of discontent.  I haven't had a conversation that lasted more than 5 mins and didnt revolve around studies with my mom/dad/uncles/cousins in years. Just being in their presence makes me feel so very uncomfortable. This is the biggest reason i simply avoid seeing people. Communication problems coupled with anxieties of all sorts make the whole process very difficult. And seeing people able to converse so well effortlessly makes this feeling all the more worse. I see people saying stuff to each other and think 'why does any of this never occur to me'? I've tried noting down interesting stuff that i can say to people, stuff i see IRL or on TV but it hasn't made much of a difference. The only proper conversations i have with people revolve around my special interests or studies. There are many ASD related issues that have significantly affected my life but this is one of the things that depress me the most.  Please share any tips that have helped you people and can help me deal with this and salvage whatever is left of my relationship."

Currently my options seem to be Sturridge, Negredo, Djouro, Benteke, Cisse and so on. Who among these should I pick? Do you have someone else in mind? Should I stick with _PERSON_ and upgrade my midfield/defense? (Don't wanna do the last one as my front line is pretty weak, i've got Soldado, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_)"

I'm now looking to give android a shot to see if things have improved since the gingerbread days and also because Moto G promises excellent value for money. However, I'm put off by my past experiences with android. I'm someone who can't stand lag at all and wants buttery smooth, consistently reliable experience. Despite all the limitations of windows phone, I loved it because there was not one time when I wanted to do something on it and it let me down. Does Moto G offer as reliable an experience on the software front? and also if i do decide to go with it, do in need to worry about performance deteriorating over time (as was the case with android a couple years ago)? Thanks"

Screen, design, camera etc. are good. I hate the placement and shape of lock button. Really hard to press. And I cant get it to connect to my campus wifi network. Thats a huge bummer. Since, 8X doesn't have a card slot, I have to now rely on data connection to download apps or do anything online. Anyway, I was hoping you guys could suggest WP8 only apps and games and also share some new things you have discovered since the WP7.5 era. I have used WP extensively in the past and am aware of most tips and tracks and also quality apps that were available for WP7. But I'm unaware of any that are WP8 specific, so I would really appreciate if you guys could help me out."
1uyzw6,10276,1389463988,windowsphone,How to set Camera360 as default camera app?,"As far as I know, this option (or something similar) was added in GDR2. I'm running GDR3 on my HTC 8X and yet I can't set Camera360 as the default camera app in settings. I can see the setting but camera360 doesn't appear as an option there. Default camera app is the only option that shows up. Is this a problem with this app in particular or you can't change default camera app setting at all? If it's former, can you guys recommend a decent alternative that can be set as default?"

24u2sp,10276,1399346847,windowsphone,Detailed notifications in Action Center?,"Action center would become a lot more useful if MS just allowed apps to display detailed notifications. That way we won't have to open the app every time to get a detailed status. One scenario where this could be useful is sports apps like sofascore. I currently have toasts enabled for it so that it sends me goal alerts and so on. However, since Action Center doesn't display full notifications, I have to open the app every time to find out who scored the goal and so on. A weird limitation.  Also, why is it not possible to clear individual notifications from Action center? What if I just want to clear one and keep the rest for an app as a sort of reminder for later? A better implementation imo would've been 'swipe the app title to the right to remove all notifications, swipe a notification to the right to remove just that one'. When I first used the Action Center, I was expecting it to be like this. It was disappointing to find out that is not the case."

But ever since I upgraded to 8.1, I've noticed that once I start playing music in IE, I cannot switch to another app. If I do so, the music stops playing. Is this an issue with grooveshark's mobile site or a limitation in IE11? Does anyone know of a workaround?  P.S. I checked and I have allowed IE to run in the background."

2n04mb,10276,1416592607,MCFC,Discuss: How would a switch to 5-2-1-2 pan out for us?,"I was toying with various formations available in FIFA and decided to play a couple of matches with City with 5-2-1-2. I used Vinny, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ as CBs with _PERSON_ left wing back and _PERSON_ right. _PERSON_ and _PERSON_ in the centre of midfield, _PERSON_ as CAM and Aguero, Jovetic upfront. It worked out pretty great for me. And that got me thinking what if City switched to something similar. Obviously just a hypothetical scenario i was hoping would ignite some discussion. I dont really see it happening anytime in near future. We dont have one decent CB pairing, where would a third CB come from. Still do you guys think such a formation could improve our defense without compromising our attacking threat too much?"
