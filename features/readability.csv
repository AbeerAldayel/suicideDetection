2,137,background 22 white male college graduate soon to enroll into graduate program with a job soon to enroll in masters program allow me to say that im in no way afraid of dying the thought of suicide is very comforting and recently it occupies quite a bit of my thoughts if i were to kill myself it would be by either gunshot or overdose both of which i have ready access to the one thing that prevents me from doing any arm is my love for my mom she has been a massive support system and source of love i would hate to disappoint her and leave her alone i have come to the conclusion that even if i stay alive eventually when she passes i will be alone in which case there would be little reason to carry on this may seem shallow and selfish it weighs on me like a ton of bricks apart of me thinks that if i went ahead and did it that i wouldnt have to worry about her that her emotions are just a product of my perception which i couldnt have if i was dead i dont seem to get as much joy out of things anymore ive started to become burnt out at my job however i do still enjoy school being around people can help distract me sometimes which i know is good im really not sure what i need to do it feels like im in a hole extremely unhappy end of rant,-160.96,98.8,103.02,0.0,6.94,55.0

21,2205,hello im in my early 20s and just going through another self loathing period im use to it its happened before and i dont see it being out of my life any time soon in my most recent period of being down i had reoccurring thoughts of suicide now when i say this i mean it in a sense that i believe many of us actually think about it what would it mean if i killed myself would it be worth it how would it affect my loved ones etc now ive been having these thoughts and i feel okay with them ive come close to acting out on them before but not recently however the problem i see is that i cant really think of talking to someone about my thoughts of suicide just based on what people initially think they will think that i need immediate help which is thoughtful but i feel as though just talking about it would be some sort of therapy in itself something to help relieve myself yet i really do think people commonly have thoughts of suicide for me at least its a common thought process which so far has always lead to the same conclusion its not worth it also i here people say that certain reasons are not good ones to commit suicide yet from what i understand its totally subjective my upbringingbiologycurrent environmental factors together create a unique thought process and experiences in which i feel that suicide would be the best optiontwo questions than1 do you believe that general thoughts of suicide as i described are common amongst the general _person_ do you feel right judging the reasons for oneself to commit suicide can you say with confidence that ones reasons may be nonsensenot sure if this post is going to do much but i just find getting my thoughts out to be relief enough take care to whoever may read this,-240.47,127.3,131.7,0.0,9.37,55.0
22,2370,this is going to be a long post if you dont care to read it then pass on by thats understandable i want you to know that while at this very moment i am not sitting here with any immediate intention to kill myself i must confess that the idea has been on my mind almost every moment of my life for the greater part of a decade but has become worse in the last five or six there are things about me that i have never shared with anyone not my friends family therapist clergyman or anyone anywhere for any reason lately i have cared less and less about continuing a life of futility i have a knee injury that has never healed properly and i am left in constant pain that feels like there is glass in my knee at no moment of a day am i not in so much pain that it is on my mind my prescription of _person_ offers no relief at all much to my dismay i have lived with this pain now for over a year and have seen medical professionals who passed it off as me just trying to avoid workin addition to that i have copd and have a hard time getting out and doing anything so between the two i have effectively become a shut in my family believes i exaggerate the pain in my knee and the troubles that come with copd to avoid workadmittedly i am a lazy person but i actually enjoy work i enjoy the feeling of completing something so when i am not longer able to do things as simple as walking my dog depression starts to kick insomething no one has noticed after over a year my family and friends dont recognize my depression because i always put a smile on because i dont want them to worry about me because then id feel guiltybut all of that i think i could live with and be okay its what has been with me for as long as i can remember around 6 or so in 28 years on this planet i have never told anyone in detail about what goes on in my head every day all day and has shaped almost every decision i have ever made in my adult life for the record i am a pacifist and do not condone violence for any reason but that is where the problem lies i act and believe in pacifism but i am not at peaceevery moment of every day for almost my entire life i love the idea of rape murder torture and straight up just mutilating people i spend all day thinking about it and how to do it the best way there are no exceptions children elderly women men transgender anyone and everyone i want everyone to suffer and feel pain agony and fear at the same time i want people to be happy and safe i do more for others than i do for myself i buy other people things with my money and rarely spend on myself i am always there to help anyone i see in need however while i do it i think of the best way to kill them or whatever elsei am so so tired of living with this in my head it is exhausting and i am so ashamed of it that i am afraid to tell my family about it everyone thinks i make things up for whatever reason so if they dont believe me over the physically evident things like my _person_ or copd why would they ever believe me about this i had found ways to help calm the thoughts down but they are either really bad outs or not sustainable marijuana i have found is a catch all remedy it helps with the knee pain it is used to help with copd and also just mellows out the thoughts in my head but it is quite expensive alcohol would lead to a dangerous addiction that has taken my father and both grandfathers so i refuse to go that route the only other thing that helped was cigarettesand well copd so i had to quit this made everything worseso here i am sitting here again wondering why i should keep trying to deal with all of this i no longer have insurance and when i tried to speak of my issues with a therapist before she dropped me as a client before we could really get into any of iti dont want to upset my family by killing myself which i think is the only reason i havent i am truly afraid i think that there will be a trigger where i am no longer concerned with keeping my thoughts in and instead they become actions i am afraid of the person i may become and for that reason i askwhy should i bother sticking around in pain waiting for the day where i say fuck it and let loose on those around me and am remembered only as a headlinetldr there isnt one,-769.96,332.8,343.52,0.0,7.17,56.0

28,3032,so im 21 years old and i feel like my life is shit i grew up with a mentally ill mother who told me all if her lifes horror stories before i made it out of elementary school horror stories that include her being beaten raped homeless i even walked in on her trying to hurt herself once she spent some time in and out of mental hospitals while i was real young i spent a good portion of my life trying to keep her happy so i wouldnt lose her ive grown detached and resentful towards herwhen i was in middle school i was bullied girls would ribbet at me and call me froggy in the 8th grade i started smoking pot in 9th grade i was molested by my ex boyfriend that i had dated the year before i say it in quotations because we were only together a few weeks my longest relationship was when i was 13 i dated a 17 yr old we dated three weeks in high school a bunch of my friends continued to hang out with the ex that molested me and eventually i got to the point where i resented them so much for it that i lost comfort with them in fact im finding that even now i feel uncomfortable around those closest to me i thought when i went to college things would get better but they didnt the day my dad took me to move into the dorms he had to wake up extra early to take my younger brother to the mental hospital i was so upset about it i opted out of all the hall bonding activities not long after my brother got out he started running away constantly meanwhile i was having trouble adjusting most days i didnt go to class i would just sleep all day and only leave the room to eat at the dining hall i almost failed out second semester but was given a second chance which i screwed away i started drinking got so trashed a couple times that police were involved i just wanted to be like everybody else who was partying and having fun and enjoying college i felt like an outcast like i always had the school finally told me i either had to go to drug and alcohol treatment or i couldnt come back so i went to treatment i should mention i was also on several medications for depression and anxiety while i was in school they tried adjusting my meds and giving me new ones but it only made things worse i would just get manic while i was in drug counseling i decided to go off meds all together i was completely clean and sober for maybe a month i had two months no drugs or alcohol i hated treatment i hated going to aa meetings three times a week and being told i was an addict in denial eventually the program i was in released me with a neutral discharge because i refused to accept my diagnosis as an addictalcoholic school tried to refuse my reentry but due to semantics they couldnt actually kick me out they did however hold me out of classes to the point i was so behind that i would never catch up when i was working and babysitting at the same time i worked my way up from driver to assistant manager at the pizza place i worked after 6 months i was drinking a lot less cuz after being clean and sober i had trouble stomaching liquor the place i worked at was awful i saw 5 managers go in and out in the year i was there the store was poorly managed and unorganized i tried as an assistant but eventually gave up it wasnt worth the effort when the people under me made more than i did a car accident left we with back neck and shoulder pain that made work more difficult i was accused of being lazy because i didnt over exert myself meanwhile i was the most reliable person there anytime any one called out or the store was in trouble i was there to save the day even before i was management now im working at another fast food place where im on my feet for 8 hours with a bad back im one of two new managers and we both suck weve both been there a month the new job stresses me out i work six days a week and i work weird hours so i barely see my friends my brothers in jail my sister is about to have my niece put in foster care because they cant deal with each other anymore to top it all off my grandmother and my great aunt who was the closest thing i had to a grandmother on my moms side both just died my grandmother a couple months ago my aunt a couple days ago i also just broke up with a guy i wasnt really dating we just spent almost every day together i fed him bought him cigarettes we smoked a good bit of money i drove him around i have bruises on my leg from where he hit me with his favorite piece while we were play fighting i keep thinking i should kill myself but i dont want to do that to my family and friends because i know there are people who love me i also do have the smallest shred of hope that things will all work out but im miserable its only a matter of time before i get fired from this job ive already called out three times in the month ive been there once i was too depressed to go in the next day i was too hung over and then my aunt died a few weeks later i think i should just do like everybody else in my family and spend some time in the mental hospital to sort myself out but im scared that will freak everybody out too plus it obviously didnt help my brother or really my mom either i dont know what to do anymore i can barely eat or sleep i lost 20 lbs in a month and while i needed to lose weight i didnt do it the healthy way i lost weight from not eatingbarely eating and getting drunk and throwing up all day i keep waking up with anxiety attacks where it feels like my skin is crawling im falling apart ive even thought about doing hard drugs cuz why not if everythings going to shit whether im trying to do the right thing or not then why shouldnt i go out with a bang party hard and speed up the dying process fuck it my best friend from high school got real bad into drugs i thought i was in love with her too thought i was in love with another junkie after her too nope im not in love with anyone youre either someone to take care of or someone to take care of me and i dont feel comfortable around the people who try to take care of me anymore i dont really feel close to anyone anymore im lookin at a life where im only gonna get crazier i just wanna give up why cant i give

have written seven suicide notes my bestfriend rah she wrote one she brought it to school she showed everyone she doesnt cut she thinks its cute i dont seven the cuts i make are deep and often her mom commited suicide and she still thinks its cuteshe doesnt know whats its like to go trough life seeing things and thinking itd be nice to use that to kill myself with shes a fake the fake shes the fakesometimes i think a little too much sometimes i have terrible thoughts i know id never do any of it id think i have the stuff here to do that i just have to find the right time sometimes i think about the ropes i still have tied up around my room that i could just slip through if i wanted sometimes i think im crazy sometimes i think im alone sometimes i think im the only one my age 14 who feels this way sometimes i think or more like wonder whats it like to be just a normal happy kid one without problems one who doesnt want to die so often so i try it for a few days but those thougths never want to leave me sometimes i think why not just slip away in the orange scent of the bath why not just slip off into the woods why not just run in front of that car why noti see people post things on here things that could help and i think wow if only i could say things like this but i cant im not good at helping all im good at is making more people worrythats what they say almost only counts in horse shoes and hand grenades so i almost cut last night i almost ditched school i almost told my best friend that her bf is lying to her face almost constantlyi almost cried i almost beat that guy up but i guess none of it counts right cause lifes not a game of horseshoes or a hand grenandei dont think i could really do it i mean i think i could but i dont really think i could thats confusing i know but dont know how else to put thati think that maybe if i had the right motive i could but that even with the right motive i wouldnt be able to go through with itthats not much less confusing though is it im not good with wordsim not good with a lot of thingsso i was looking through some old myspace posts yes i know what your thinking myspace really but its the only way i can keep in contact with some of my family and i get this notification about a comment and when i look at it its someone telling my brother that he should commit suicide and im just sitting there shocked that someone could do that when hes in that much painedit when i said something to them they replied something along the lines of go back to your hole you little rat my only thoughts were wow a disney reference if you have never seen the movie ratatouille you wouldnt understand the rats name is remmy and thats what my bro calls mei had ropes from past times when i thought i would really commit suicide well today while i was cleaning ym room i took them and burned them along with a few suicide notes i havent had any thoughts of killing myself latley i acually really think i might be getting betterso my friend has this boyfriendbefore they started dating he was planning to commit suicide he told me this after they started dating and when she asked him out he felt like he owed her his life because he hasnt wanted to do any self harm or anything since and when my best freind set me up with my boyfriend the thoughts of suicide didnt stop so is my friends bf hiding something or am i just messed up you know more than people think i amso after a little less than a month of no suicidal thoughts and about 3 months of not cutting i just went and cut i dont know why i dont really need to my life has been pretty good to me latley i just kind of felt like i needed to cuthonestly my friends just laugh in my face they call my a slut and talk about me behind my back they lie to me they wouldnt care my mom is constanly telling me to be like the other kids and that im not doing things the way she is expecting me to and why cant i just be normal my dad would take forever to notice and when he finally would hed go out to the bar since he wouldnt have to deal with me anymore my boyfriend wouldnt care he wants to break up with me and i know it but he doesnt want to hurt me any of the people i honestly cared about dont even remember me or they hate me too much to even say my name and any one who comments on here i doubt any of you really care im just some kid on the internet i think ill just go nowmy brother was in intnse care because he slit his wrist we just got a call that he passed onkyle was adopted and when my mom and stepdad got a divorce he went back to roaming from place to place when he was a kid he ran away from his moms house then child services took him away becasue she beat him alot when my mom adopted him he was doing drugs and some other stupid stuff after the divorce the rest of the family stopped talking to him and i am the only one who kept in touch he was in and out of jail alot again before one day he just kinda had enough i guess and broke downbut i came backso last night i told my boyfriend everything we got into this huge fight and i cried alot which i dont normally do i posted a status on facebook sayingpeople would be better off this way i wouldnt be worrying everyone i wouldnt have to keep up my act i wouldnt have to lie to keep secrets from the ones i really do love i wouldnt have to deal with any one id be problem free and so would you for the most part its easy if youd just lemme disappear i wouldnt come back to bother you after saying i wouldnt id be gone for good and thats the way it should be im too much of a problem and too much for anyone to deal with im sorry sorry for wasting your time sorry for taking up space sorry for hurting you sorry for not telling you sorry if you miss mei told myself before i texted my boyfriend that he was going to say mean things and not to let them get to me i didnt listen to myself thoughso anywaysi told him i was going to slit my wrist and he replied remember down the river not across the street my friend cussed him out and talked me out of it then he texted people for me for the rest of the night because i was crying so much sorry if this was a little out of order or confusing to read i went by what i remembered firsttldr posted a suicide note on facebook dumped my boyfriend took it harder than him had a friend talk me out of slitting my wrist my best friend is amazing and i pretty much owe my life to him right nowwhen i first moved here it was summertime and i didnt know anybody until one day this guy showed up and started messing with me and my cousin when i realized that it was someone messing with us i went along with it and acted scared later we hung out in the yard we talked about random things my mom met him and she actually let us hang out i moved across town but we still kept in touch it has been 5 years since i met _person_ and he has helped me through so much he has listened to everything i have had to say he has held me while i cried he has talked me out of suicide multiple times and most of all he has been there right by my side every step of the way _person_ is the best friend anyone could ask for and i think everyone should have someone like him around k so most of this is pretty pointless till you get to the endit will prolly get deleted but oh wellno really thats it im donehello my name is taylor i was just wondering if

other people then had an anxiety attack while talking to someone i thought was my friend but i mess everything up im too scared to ever talk to him again i cause problems for the other which is my boyfriend im so messed up and i out him through so much that i dont mean to i cant do this im so scared i cant do anything i dont wanna talk to my boyfriend anymore because i only cause problems and i know it i cant kill myself apparently its not working again i wish it would finally work i guess i just cant do thisi think i should honestly just get over myself and finally make the choice to end it i just keep stalling ive tried before but i havent succeeded i dont think theres a point being here anymore its just one bad thing after anotheri cant do anything right i guess i just want to vent any people i care about all have these bases of close friends that will try and help them or intervene when things get bad ive been one of the people helping all of them but no one cares to do that for me i pass out really easily my parents dont like me my family is just messed up i have too many health problems i cant succeed in killing myself and so many other things i dont mean to be selfish when i say i wish i had that group of people i just mean heres an example i have had issues with hydration for years and heat problems i pass out or get close to it really often recently another girl at school in similar classes has developed a similar thing everyone cares about her everyone shes an awesome girl im not saying anything bad about her but no one notices mine or cares the few people that notice that i care for and help them when things get bad theyve never done that for me i wish i was worth that much to someone my family just loves telling me im shit then half heartedly pretending to be supportive or whenever i work every costumer in the room acknowledges any other employee but me if ive been cleaning for an hour barely able to stand up i have minor scoliosis not complaining but it makes things where you bend over harder and another employee comes out theyll compliment how great theyre doing and ignore me last summer i would try to talk to people i know online theyd ignore me some would say hi first then after like two messages decide im not worth talking to why doesnt anyone care about me i feel selfish wanting that but everyone seems to have it but me i guess in reality if i had close friends that cared and they tried to intervene and talk to me about whats going on id just start hyperventilating and freaking out im not worth it anyways i guess havent been since i was born no wonder no one wants to be friends with me i cant even succeed at getting rid of myself im useless and stupidi just got home from prom should be great but plans took forever to make and were ruined multiple times one in my friend group kept slyly insulting me because i asked them if they were okay months ago because it seemed like something was wrong they were being really mean then

68,6826,my story is a long one as far as i remember it began when i was 4 years old although its not a true start of it its only when i got cautious about it it started when i was bornas far as my memories reach i was never able to find friends of course i was communicating with other children in kindergarden but i noticed that others are building some stronger friendships while i was only aimlessly talking to others they thought i was strange bullied me i only got an opportunities to talk more with people i wanted to when theirs friends were not present it was years of sadness of lonelynessparents and my relatives always said i was pessimistic tried to cheer me up but they didnt understand what i really neededchristmas then was and still is a celebration i hate the most my parents were always saying that santa can bring me anything i wanted but they were lieing cause i needed a friend a person who wouldnt bully me who enjoyed talking with meyears have passed i started attending a school but besides that nothing was changing yes i met new people here but they were the same shadows of the past haunting me with their bad words people were either ignoring me as a person or bullying me they only wanted good for themselves ignoring my feelings and needs i failed to find friends here too i was a freak listening to funeral music as they called iteven when i actually thought i found a suitable person possible friend they berrayed me joined those who hated me then i started regretting trying to find friends and thought it would be better just to be alone but it led to even darker times i started thinking about suicide always used an opportunity to cause pain to myself it helped me to relief from the pain i suffered inside although i knew that in reality it changed nothingand now im in the last 12th grade and everythings the same i have no friends if i make any they leave me really quickly im bound to be alone and its too difficult for me i guess for others tooi think its about time to leave this world,-297.31,149.1,154.11,0.0,9.26,56.0

72,7241,it just seems like the best option i dont even know why but today i learned that the only reason my mom hasnt yelled at me for being an attentionseeking bitch is because my stoic dad who is in uae right now with another 8 months before he comes home told her not to because hes worried about me and you know its bad when my dad starts to worry but i have a few great friends who care and a great life and ambitions and dreams but i just want all of this yelling and screaming and hating myself to end permanently and its not easy i tried to commit suicide three years ago and again two weeks ago i was supposed to have an appointment with a doctor this week my counselors told my mom that she had to schedule an appointment and yet shes said nothing she hasnt even brought it up its like she doesnt see how serious this isits like she doesnt even care this post seems kind of all over the place but i just wanted to let it outi feel a bit selfish posting here when there are others that are closer to death than i am i just i dont have a plan yet and im scared that ill come up wih one soon i dont want that to happen i dont want to die but everywhere i turn it seems like all i do is fuck up everything my own mother tells me im useless almost daily and she knows im suicidle which leads me to wonder maybe she doesnt want me alive it sounds so selfish i have younger siblings that would miss me or at least i hope they would but im 15 and turning to alcohol for an escape im trying to stop for my boyfriend and for my best friends but i dont want to live like this any longer on so many slopes that one day ill trip and everything will snowball and ill be alive to watch everything i have and everything i am burn to the ground and ill just be left to pick at the ashesi want to be dead before that happens i dont want this life where my own mother knows im walking towards the edge and wont help me but encourages by her hateful words where my best friends overprotective boyfriend tells me im just like the rest of the generation of stupid girls who give up everything for nothing where the only place i know that is safe is my boyfriends arms and that this paradise is so rarely visited where i dont want to jump but the unknown at the edge of the cliff is so much more inviting and maybe the angels with soft down wings will stroke my hair while i sleep forever i just dont know what to do or where to go from hereive made too many mistakes to count too many mistakes that i cant deal with everyone around me tells me that its the selfish thing to do that id make an impact on them if i died but they would all move on at some point anyway rightive tried so hard to be perfect like them despite the hand i was dealt at birth so cant i have this for me ill give it all back ill give everything away just to let everything go to sleep for eternity and not worry about getting in anyones way ever again i want to remove the problem from everyones life and that problem is me im easily replaced in every aspect except my family and theyre the ones that will hurt the most but one day theyll move on and be okay everything will return to normal im not important im not outstanding im not beautiful or perfect hell im not even close to acceptable ive made terrible mistakes and i cant make any more i dont want the rest of my life and id give the extra years away if i could i just cant deal with anything anymore i am too weak and too fragile for this world i wish it didnt have to be this way ever but im not good enough i never was and i see that now so im sorry _person_ im sorry kayla im sorry to the love of my life _person_ im sorry for all of my family and anyone who knows me but i cant keep going i wasnt born with the strength you were im broken shattered i hope you tell _person_ that it is the weak thing to do and that i am a perfect example of weakness i dont know what to do it seems that suicide would be the only way out and thats what i do run at the first sign of dangeri dont know what else to say but if you see this thanks for reading through i appreciate it strangerim sorry im not the responsible woman you want me to be im sorry for being such a pain in your ass most of all i think im sorry for not screaming at you that it wasnt my fault that you cant see that im dying right in front of you im not the selfcentered girl you think i am i spend every

some of my feelings about school to my parents but they are not doing anything about it they think it is some kind of joke they dont take it seriously i want to find a way to motivate my self to do well in school but i cant there is nothing to motivate me my parents yell at me and yell and yell and that is all they do they think that is the way to motivate me so does my teachers i like to be alone with my electronics as this calms me down i listen to music to calm me down as well i also live with a brother that has anxiety anger issues and bipolar he makes friends better then me in fact he is all of those things that i am not he always does better in school straight as i dont know how he does it i feel like school is a waste of time i feel like teachers and parents dont know what its like if they were us teachers are supposed to help students do better and find a way to motivate the students like i said i and no one else has found a way to motivate me i feel like school is not teaching you to become smart but everything is based on memory i am totally against the idea of school everything about it but it just gets to me i am depressed in school i dont talk dont listen get yelled at i hate it and no one is doing anything to change it i have been getting suicide thoughts since fall they are becoming more frequent they were monthly then weekly and now they are almost daily i am depressed more frequently i sometimes like to listen to chill music and look at beautiful landscapes and say to myself will i ever achieve anything will i ever make it will i be alive in a year you guys are probably asking you are killing yourself because of school and family in the summer yes it is summer and it is much more relieving i have countless hours in my room spending time on my computer this is probably all i do i love it and enjoy it with a passion my parents hate it so much we were at the dinner table talking about regular things until school came up i mentioned to them that this is summer and not school its a break from school they dont care what i say when its making choices for myself my parents have forced me to play piano soccer karate drama etc i have quit all of them i have never had a normal conversation with my dad or my step mom like literally never not even joking they all end up with yelling at me just tonight did they yell at me again i tend to back talk a lot which is not good but i have no way of defending my self they think all i do is play games not true but they dont believe me they hate what i do with my life and that i should try other things like i said i hate everything else just tonight they decided to wake me up every morning at 7 to study i thought the work was done you know i was so happy i was not depressed as much but this is gonna kill me literally my parents hate me and i never get to see my mom a lot but when i do i love to stay with her i want to live with her but now that this is happening i cant take it anymore this isnt the first time my parents are fed up with me about school this year i couldnt go to a family reunion with my mom to florida because of my grades i really wanted to go and tried soooo hard in school but my grades didnt go up they went down i sit down and think about what ill be when i grow up i dont see anything good or anything at all i dont know what to do with my future i dont think ill be living by the time i am 20 i hate this society sooo damn much no one cares about anyone no one were all equal you know ug i am so unsuccessful i cant take it anymore and i cant take any more actions i give up with my life so much work and no love and compassion to me i cry every freaking single day by myself i want to kill my self i want to kill myself in the future i dont know when or how i have no plans or way but i want to i just need to stop this before i take action i hate my life and want to end it soon,-1148.22,480.2,495.2,0.0,6.01,56.0

118,11464,i have friends and a loving family that i hate the family is unable to help me at anything and they know it they compensate by being extraordinarily accommodating friends i have a few good ones and lots of ones who are better described as friendly drinking buddies etc i tried to be friends with them before realizing i dont actually like them as most experienced in this kind of trauma can tell friends cant really help in these kind of situations oh you love me and will always be there for me that does not really mean anything the better friends might be great cheerleaders but we have to face our demons all by ourselves and in the darkest of times their clichéd words all but distant muted noise that does not matteri tried getting better with girls i find pretty i got better and would get them to show interest like theyd get all bubbly and lit up when i awkwardly tried flirting but the moment they opened up and showed they liked me i shut down like madagascar there is no way theyd get me or still like me when i show my weakness and show that im not the idealized essence of alpha that a girl would want plus why the fuck would i want to share my weak struggle with my monsters to anyone im quite ashamed about being weak enough to have to deal with thisi still kept trying you would not believe it why would some guy try pickup and not actually respond when girls open up i almost turned asexual dont trust anyone really im not angry about most people its not their fault that they cant or wont try to help first life is pretty occupying leaving us with not enough time or energy to just help around second we dont really have the ability to help anyone there is always great distances we cant reach the person is stuck in a maze in his own mind in his own altered skewed perspective battling monsters all to real and all too absurd that they are almost powerless to fight off and all we can do is watch and tell ourselves it only happens to other people its like a footage of a trainwreck that happened decades ago and is now forgotten somehow that makes it okay because although none of it really is nice we need coping mechanisms to be able to live in this reality we find ourselves in but the guy in the train that day did not want to be in a video in _person_ he just wanted to be reading a nice book in a train while travelling off to the snowcovered towns in chile or see the wild burning wastes of the australian outback he wanted to do photography write and travel and be loved for it he wanted to have figured out what he wanted to do with his life already and be good at it he wanted to have dressed stylishly that day and wear the sexiest rugged brown boots he wanted to have long hair and a short beard he wanted to be awesome he wanted to teach his father how to express emotions so he could tell him hes proud of him he wanted to show his mom how not to be scared of everything and not be depressed all the time he wanted to show his sister that being a corporate sellout is okay and she should not punish herself so much for it and she need not abandon all the cool and creative little things she loved for it well actually i dont feel completely suicidal now but i know itll be back its always back i can still feel the presence almost mocking me lovingly aww you i hope you make it this is what happens i fight it back the darkness every day every day im more tired and weak of it all sick of having to go through the fight ashamed of being weak and cowardly enough to not take drastic changes to actually solve all of thisi lost 50 pounds in eight months by simply willing myself to do it i did not take in the calories no exercise no running nothing i simply willed myself into the discipline that takes a lot away i dont think i can do something like that though i used to write well i spent thousands of hours writing published hundreds of pieces in dailies now i feel like im writing total crap i played brain age today and got 22 which is one year younger than my age thats the highest score i ever got but i was convinced the game was being condescending and gave me extra points because it took pity on me thats actually what i felt we come here on suicidewatch because we needed someone to care for ourselves then we see others suffer and in pain and we empathize and we try our best to help we put our pain aside and try to help our fellow man this is incredibly kind sometimes what theyre suffering for seems trivial sometimes the enormity of their situation scares us we hide our true assessments and go help anyway knowing full well rarely people have climbed back from depths like these but we try we feel compelled to help to be excellent to the ones who suffer somebody has toit does not end up mattering though the person were rooting for and pouring our hearts out for is stuck somewhere else in an altered plane were our kind words scroll away as meaningless statistics and news from a war you do not care about he now knows there are people who are uncomfortable that hes suffering there are people who are trying to help they might even like him but it does not matter in the city that does not exist on he and his monsters are there its only upto him to fight to hold back the tide to make sense of what he will that there are people who want him to win but its dark and deep and so far away from anyone its slightly cold and you almost feel the wind its really empty only hes there eyes open wide and looking about in the middle of the street and sometimes even the monsters are not there with himtldr outside the window the sky is a milky blue i can see a pink and red building and green as cucumber trees there is a red lamp beside the window it has yellow fish painted on it there is also a fish painted on the window if i move my head it looks like its swimming,-1052.13,441.2,454.32,0.0,8.21,61.0

148,15000,its another one of those nights that im really considering iti have one friend basically an ex that gave up on me a long time ago because she has to focus on her own life and because she didnt want to deal with my depression anymore on one hand i desperately want to ask her for help on the other i know its best for her not to i also know that she will avoid iti have family two parents that im relying on right now and a brother i barely ever see every day i have to listen to yelling as my parents argue either with each other or with myself i cant make a point because im living with them in order to avoid paying for rent food transport and they would quickly try to get rid of mei have no job im in the recruiting process to the army and its already taken close to a year to get through is that the job i want sure it works paying for college but what about after that im not smart im not rich im not attractive im basically living my life off the assumption that somebody will pick me up for a joband then what i work 40 hours a week so that i can pay to live and i live my life working 40 hours a weekpeople always say things change it gets better they care bullshit these are not temporary problems average canadian debt without mortgage is roughly 21000 most people do more work than living while in this debt and get totally screwed by it im also looking at a future workplace run almost entirely by machines so how exactly am i supposed to believe things get better i think its very clear that they only get worse and for fuck sake when people say they care thats a lie no doubt about it if i died tonight it would only affect those that have direct ties to me and those are very temporary problemsis anyone capable of proving to me that this is all worthwhile that in some twisted grand scheme i somehow come out of life with a benefit far as im concerned theres absolute nothingness waiting on the other side so why should i delay itive now spent about half of my life wanting to die for half of my life i havent known happiness or joy i havent been able to have fun its just been empty if im not sad or angry im just neutral thats what gets to meive had to cut off my only friendship the only person i really respect and felt i could talk to is gone because ive been hurting her too much i had four things holding me back from suicide and she was one so im down to three my parents in their 60s wont last terribly long so soon enough ill be down to two at that point itll be fairly easy to cut all ties and just go for it ignoring the unfinished business and ignoring the chances of failureive always known that suicide would be how i go ive always known that it would have to be painless and as much as possible quick it seems however that im watching it slowly and painfully unfold before me every day theres no winningno pain no mess no emotional aftermath from anybody discovering it was suicide the perfect death just a descent into nothingness pure and without sorrowwhy would i do this without a second thought yet i hesitate with any other method i want to find a way to overcome whats stopping me after all i can live in constant fear and pain or die satisfied knowing my existence will cease forever,-544.63,246.2,254.64,0.0,7.98,58.0

157,15611,hello there not really sure how quick the response time on this subreddit is but i really hope its not just post now and expect response in 5 to 10 minutes because im really not sure about thatanyway right now im trying to talk myself into calling the suicide hotline but my only issue is im really trying to force myself to talk and i really dont want to talk right now i mean i can type just fine but actually verbally saying something sounds absolutely horrifying and i really just want to stop and just avoid all of this having to talk to people and kill myself to be blunti guess i should give some background as to what is going on that would help i just skimmed over some other topics on here and the rules for a few seconds before jumping into this because i really feel like im in full panic mode and my ocd is going off so really twitchy and all that so what set me off is that im transgender and occasionally get episodes of dysphoria what that means exactly is every so often there are moments of extreme emotional pain and its awfulive been transitioning for about 3 and a half years and i hear stuff from people that have been transitioning for this long and that they feel much better and rarely feel awful and their lives did a 360 and its going smooth whatever and after 3 and a half years of this there has been some improvement but for this to still be happening is fucking insane this shouldnt be happening anymoreso apart from that its also around may june which is graduation time and occaisonally you go on facebook and it is swamped with friends posting graduation pictures and all this stuff and after going to community college for i think 5 years im 23 and seeing people doing that and getting on with their lives it is really toxic to see all that also never been the most social person basically a loner so seeing things from old friends who arent friends anymore and people being social and groups of friends and all that stuff it really fucking hurts like a lotalso been looking over other peoples transitions for the past hour and ive been making myself feel worse in an attempt to get myself to feel bad enough to kill myself and im still doing it because like i said i just want it to stop and no offense to whoever reads all this but if you dont know much about transgender related topics i dunno if you should reply really because honestly you might unintentionally say something stupid and make me feel worse or do in that case whatever works,-383.59,182.3,188.06,0.0,9.31,61.0

expect anyone to try and help me or idk i just didnt know what to do i dont think ill ever find the guts to kill myself but i do want to die also i created a fake fb of a girl and i changed my status to in a relationship with herme im going fucking insane i need help but i just dont care also english is probably horrible but its not my native language _person_this might turn out longim 16 and 12 years old my name country and everything else is irrelevant let me start from my childhood my mom beat me up and my dad was a sailor so he would be gone for 6 months at a time and when he was back my parents would constantly shout at each other then my father would go out and get drunk and end up sleeping at my grandmas for a few dayssure my childhood sucked but its nothing compared to my miserable existence nowi used to have friends i had good grades i was somewhat normal but as life progressed i found out i didnt really have friends they would get together without me not invite me to their birthdays i just gave up on the idea of having friends thinking they werent such an important part of lifebut the summer 2 years ago being all alone i spent the entire summer inside just watching movies all day going out once a day to get something to eat and thats all id do i started feeling lonely god i felt lonely thats when i got in a state of depression i started hating myself the way i look the person i had grow up to become i realised im stupid ugly fat i didnt care about any of that before i used to think im normal that id live a normal life be a part of the system get good grades get a good job have a family and finally die the following year my grades got bad i started hating school the teachers my classmates i found the material we were learning to be boring and pointless so i had absolutely no desire to learn it since i thought the educational system was feeding me useless information with a spoonthe next year it got even worse _person_ even worse life even worse much lonelier scared i wanted to kill myself i remember the 1st time i just sat on a bench for 2 hours and thought about how much i want to die i went to my gp i dont really know what its called in english but basically i asked for antidepresants she sent me to a psychiatrist in the local madhouse i spoke to her about the way i felt and since i was underage she said id have to call my parents and i did thats when they found out the way they explained it was to this point they didnt know about my condition they just thought im kind of a distant person not showing much emotion a part of being a teenager but it wasnt like that what bothered me more is that they found out i didnt want that to happen because i knew that theyd be overly loving and carring for some time and then theyd go back to the way they were before as if nothing had happened well thats exactly how things wentanyways i changed 2 doctors both of them tried to help me but they couldnt all they did was perscribe a dozen pills which didnt do anything but tranquilize me like a horse not making me feel better but saditated enough so i dont do anything kill myself which i thought about a lot came to the conclusion the best way would be to drowni had found this subreddit for some time at new years eve 2013 i read a lot of peoples life storries how miserable their lives where their expectations that things would get better but they never did and since i was alone my parents gone somewhere i got out in the rain sat on a bench and stayed there for 2 hours just thinking about my life that changed me it made me realise a lot of things all i ever wanted was to be loved youd think most guys my age just want to fuck some girl no emotions no nothing but im not like that sure i want to have sex but whats even stronger in me is the desire to just hug a girl hold her thight as time slows down and stops being in each others arms for what seems like an ethernity softly kiss thats all i want but as old as i am ive never kissed a girl had a gf nothing i dont wanna become like that guy who killed the people in california complaining how he never got laid and what not i dont want to become psychotic like him but my life is just falling apart i have no ambition perspective living day by day not thinking about the future because i stoped caring as if im already dead and life doesnt matter i confessed my love to a girl because i knew at one point she liked me but i had so many things on my plate i didnt do anything about that i just let her go and when i told her i love her she didnt know what to say and eventually just cut me off saying her feelings for me were just temporaty and that now i mean nothing to her she was the best thing that couldve happened in my life and i missed it at this point failing school barely getting out of bed every morning feeling like crap all the time all i want to do is die and ill do it i just needed to tell someone my story even if only one person reads this i need to know at some point in time another living being knew who i was and my story so that i dont leave this world as if i had never been in iti dont think anyone can help me at this point i really dont _person_ isnt my 1st language most of it i havent learned in school but by watching cartoon network as a child so i can speak it well but punctuation and stuff like that is quite possible to be

197,19347,i seldom give serious thought to how i would potentially kill myself but dying is something i think about almost everyday id say suicide has been on my mind regularly for the past three years or so but i dont think id ever really do it even if i might occasionally fantasize about it its hard for me to tell whether i have a serious problem or not because i dont have much trouble doing everything im supposed to do i have a good gpa i take care of my apartment to my satisfaction im at university and they do have licensed professional counselors on staff and i have seen them before but im afraid to talk to them about my concerns in this area because im aware that universities in my country prefer to suspend or expel suicidal students so that they arent liable if those students do kill themselves i know you guys cant diagnose people but maybe i could have an advisory opinion on whether i could have a serious problem or not i feel normal but i suppose people with mental disorders dont always know that what theyre experiencing is not normalim usually a pretty good student my gpa is 375 and i usually make as with a few as and fewer grades in the b range but this term ive been doing considerably worse i had to drop my abstractalgebra class because i was so lost and now im only taking three classes but even though im now officially a parttime student im not doing that great if the semester were to end today id have like a d in differential equations i have a test in that class on wednesday and im trying to study so i can improve my grade but theres so much material to review im not used to having so much pressure on me to perform well on a particular assignment because usually my grades are so good that any one bad grade is no big deal i dont know if i could live with myself if i got less than a b my all time low in this _person_ class,-278.03,141.7,147.06,0.0,8.21,61.0

213,20503,somy roommate had a breakdown thursday night shes been having a difficult semester emotionally but nowhere near as bad as anyone realizedso thursday night five people sat up in our room with her as she sobbed and threatened suicide and explained her plan to certain people while trying to hide it from others eventually the massive amount of alcohol in her system got the better of her and she fell asleep we were able to notify proper authorities that she was threatening suicide that she had a plan and that she claimed to be intent on acting upon it she was required to be assessed at our counseling center we were able to leave to go to bed around 5amfriday during the day she showed no remorse she was mad at us for taking her alcohol she was upset that we had gotten the dean involved she was adamant that she would lie at her counseling appointment that day and she did and she was defending her right to kill herself this was the last straw for mei called her mother the hope was that she would spend friday night with the mother in a hotel room spend the weekend at home and come back with an eye opening experiencewe were wrong repeat of thursday night but with less suicidal threatening and more crying she refused to see the mother she said that we all thought her feelings were stupid and we were judging her for feeling this way we all asserted that she was the only one saying she was stupid and that we just wanted to help but we didnt know what to give herbtw the thing she insists she needs is her exboyfriend back but he broke with her because she was codependent and abusive and is specifically avoiding contact so that she has to get help the problem is much much bigger than the boyfriend but she pins the burden of everything on his _person_ anyway we finally got her to sleep around 5am saturday morning and i went to bed hoping to keep an eye on her at 7am she woke up i was out like a light hadnt slept at all the night before and broke a bottle of bacardi 151 in the shower i woke up around 730 to the sound of her sobbing and literally pulled a bottle of vodka out of her hands and we talked until 930am she finally agreed that she would be willing to go with me to a hospital with a psychiatric unit to get assessed later today but on the condition that her ex boyfriend show up for a while he did not pick up his phone good on him i watched her as she sobbed herself back to sleep saying she would do nothing but stay in bed and that she would not be willing to go talk to someoneand then i called the mom back im sorry but when i am pulling a bottle of vodka out of someones hands at 730 in the fucking morning i am not prepared to be cautious and sensitive the mother and i spoke and we spoke to a crisis center and we spoke to a representative from the dean and we came up with a list of options for my roommate 1 was to go voluntarily to a hospital with the mother they got worse from thereafter a halfhour confrontation the roommate agreed to go to a psych unit on the condition that afterwards the mother leave immediately because of course she was fine and she would be released she was furious at me for calling the mother for officially reporting the first suicidal incident and for generally being a tattletalenow shes been told she can be released on the condition that she does not consume alcohol and she can find someone willing to spend the night with her and keep her safe sorry were not putting up with it a third night in a row the mother said that she will stay with her daughter which i think is fine and would even get them separate but adjacent hotel rooms but the roommate is having none of this shes currently trying to get someone to be there for her but i think we the friends are presenting a pretty unified front on this in that shes called each of us in turn and weve all said that we think she needs professional help not a friend to enable her ive also talked to the team privately and we all agree that we dont think we can afford to show her a third night in a row that she can get all the affirmation she wants and needs by just making agonizing demands on us we need sleep we need peace we need to be able to take care of ourselves and each otherso in the morning i will have my roommate back she will be furious at me for abandoning her to either spend the night with her mother or in a hospital she will be furious at everyone but i live with her i do not feel safe leaving her alone at night but i also do not have the emotional reserves to fight with her over my decisions nor to stay up unable to sleep as she sobs all night i know i was right i feel completely justified for calling in professionals and for abandoning her to the only people who can help her get better instead of just making her feel betterim wondering i suppose how i proceed from here so that i can actually have my own life this semester perhaps it was a bad move but i did all of her laundry for her one manifestation of her depression has been that she has not done a single load of laundry all semester and my room smelled like someone vomited up a yeast infection and there were molding shrunken apple cores among her dirty panties and im sorry if that was not the right thing to do to empower her but i just could not continue to live like that cleaned all the mold and mildew up from her side of the room and made her bed for her ive cleaned the broken glass from the bathroom and im prepared to spend as much or as little time with her as she wants i just dont know what to actuallydo i dont know if its the right thing to do to defend myself against her or if i just let her talk and empathize i dont know if i glue myself to the room so she never gets any alone time or if i back off and give her the room to herself a few nights a week i dont know if i openly talk to her about her abuse of her prescribed pills she has adderal and amphetamines or the fact that she said her plan was to kill herself with those and alcohol am i allowed to do roommatethings with her like ask her to take out the trash or am i just walking on eggshells until christmas what do i do if shes just really sad and crying all night and i cant sleep or if she as she did last night wanders out of the room with a bottle and i have to run after her to bring her back in how do i make sure shes safe without giving up my own freedom i just dont know and i need guidance,-1188.14,493.5,508.26,0.0,7.69,59.0

217,20908,i started the night with an ama post_url_ about my bipolar disorder hoping for some catharsis and releaseit hasnt helpedthe night has dragged on and become progressively worse ive tried talking to a couple of people but they just cant begin to understand the depths of what im dealing with to them im just defeatist just being difficult just choosing to remain unhappy when i could so easily find some way to get _person_ family is deeply religious im an atheist i cant talk to them anymore because all they want to do is preach to me about how if i would just turn to god all this would go awayso here i am im not ready to do anything yet but ive been down this road far too many times over the past decade and i know the warning signs it wont take long before im making serious preparations for being gonei feel abandoned and alone like nobody would ever want to care like all i do is frustrate everyone around me until they give up on me in disgust or maybe just keep banging their heads against the brick wall of the disease out of some twisted sense of biological obligationi just want to feel like someone gives a shitit should say plenty about my state of mind that im turning to a community of anonymous strangers for supporti dont know what to do anymore so here it is anything youve got is deeply appreciatednights have always been the worst for me occasionally things will get bad during the day but night is usually when it crops upi feel torn on being here tonight im a fiercely independent person and scrabbling around for bits of help from internet strangers runs deeply counter to that i feel like im wasting peoples time chewing up attention being melodramatic like theres other people out there who are in serious imminent danger of hurting themselves who deserve the help more than i do i know i wont do anything tonight except maybe tear up my wrists some more but im not going to die yet so why am i wasting space with this i dont knowmaybe its just part of the disease maybe its just a side effect of the deepening blackness that has become my life maybe im wrong but if you have any question about whether to spend your concern on me or someone else make it someone else i think part of me just wants the attentionfor a number of reasons i learned from a young age to be a very good actor i can take on any number of different personae become an outwardly totally different person at will i abuse this skill constantly to keep people around me from knowing the truth of my situation a few people know bits and pieces but nobody knows the whole story not my family not my doctor not my best friendi guess i feel like if anyone knew the truth they wouldnt want to care i feel like no matter what i do nobody will want to be around the real me so i lie im a damned good liar but thats just one more reason why i cant accept the idea that someone would be able to tolerate me if people knew how much i distort the truth how could they possibly put up with the strain of constantly wondering if im being honestive almost resigned myself to the strong possibility that i will carry out the rest of my life alone just as i am now the problem is i know im strong enough to survive it and even be successful so i can face that prospect and accept it even thrive on it to some extent but i desperately secretly hope that isnt how it all goes downanyways if you bothered to read all of that little bitchfest im sorry for wasting your timei feel like a whore for even doing thisi dont even really know what to say anymorea big part of me hates complaining about things for a number of varied reasons so its hard to come here and just whine and bitch for no real purpose unfortunately i feel like thats the best recourse i have right noweveryone i know is either asleep or too busy to get involved it figures that the one time that is really hard for me nights has to overlap directly with the time when the fewest people are available to be there when its easy for people to help i dont need it but when it requires going a little bit out of their way they wont do it and naturally thats when im the most desperate the feelings of despair and abandonment just feed themselves on this ironyi feel like i lack the energy and desire to continue fighting im still cycling between deep depression and hypomania often within the space of a few hours its so exhausting worse its virtually impossible to treat with medication the drugs take far too long to kick in and address only one half of the equation the best i can do is ride it out theres no hope for eliminating the symptoms entirely ill be stuck with this pattern for the rest of my lifesure i may have periods of stability and lucidity i may go for months at a time with no problems as i did earlier this year but looming in the back of my mind is the constant reminder that someday ill have to go through it all again the aching the anger the fear the rush the buzz the high the cutting the selfmedicating the long nights of trying to talk myself out of hospitalization or even being fully committedi am so very tired of this even as i sit here wide awake against my wishes and full of energy im drained past the point of being empty i havent just given it all ive got im in debt and i have no idea how to find my way back to stability and normalcyive started making my final plans im working on a checklist of all the loose ends i want to tie up before i go and all the people i need to write to i know how devastating it will be when i finally check out im under no illusions that this will make things better for anyone but me call me selfish if you want if ending the most miserable state of existence i can fathom is selfish then so be it im an asshole but isnt it just as selfish for everyone else in my life to demand that i stay in this state forever just so they can avoid the pain of losing me who is really making the more selfish demands heresome of my friends need to know what theyve done to help because they have helped a few others need a swift kick in the ass for being more or less useless my family is probably the hardest one despite their misguided attempts to drown me in religion as a cure for all this they at least care enough to try something i want my doctor to know that i think he did his best with the material he had available and that i dont think of this as a failure on his part at allthis is entirely my own decisioni dont know why im even posting this maybe its to struggle for some last illusion of having someone here to fight with me maybe i just dont want to disappear into oblivion when the time comes and this is my way of leaving a trace of who i am and what happened to memaybe its just a totally selfindulgent smear of pathetic ink at the end of the otherwise forgettable pagei think my biggest regret is that ill probably wake up again tomorrowi almost posted this using my normal account because part of me really wants it to be known whats going on i really cant fully justify my decision to remain anonymous it does interfere with the possibility of someone directly being able to assist in the situation but anything is better than nothing and im facing some scrutiny at the moment for newjobpurposes so i dont need this crap of all things showing up and complicating mattersthe truth is im skating a fine and dangerous line in my life at the moment and the excess pressure has built to the point where it needs to vent or ill rupture some capillaries in some vital location ordinarily this is the kind of thing you take to your friends or your family or your religious compatriots or whatever this is not the sort of shit which is appropriate normal or healthy to unload in public to a bunch of strangers on a medium like the internet chances are this little nugget is going to haunt me for a long time or would have if id attached my real name to itbut im well past caring and deeply reckless at the moment so im gonna do it anyways and you get to point and laugh winwin right everyone loves a hit of schadenfreudemy friends are to a person in no position to do anything at this point my family doesnt need any extra baggage to cope with either i find no particular appeal in sitting in a dark wooden booth talking to a priest for a number of reasons not least of which being that im an atheist and place no stock in the mental competence of the professional clergy theres always doctors but theyre expensive and even the good ones dont make house calls at 230 am short of buying a stuffed ostrich and seeking its counsel im low on alternatives although one could make a pretty good case that talking to a toy bird is less insane than journaling about this on the webits hard to contextualize a weekend in which youve alternated more times than can be counted between feeling like the second incarnation of the christ and seriously pondering chambering a round and finding out if youll have enough remaining milliseconds of consciousness hear the sound of your own grey matter covering the walls there are points where the two just overlap and in some twisted psychological paradox you hate yourself for being so happy and are overjoyed at being so miserableto be sure they make medication for this i have a really nice prescription for some of it four of them in fact but theres a minor problem here known as noncompliance some people have reasons for not popping their daily dose i dont one of the most deeply frustrating aspects of my condition is the fundamental conflict between my pragmatic analytical nature and my refusal to expend a minimal amount of effort every morning to stave off the onset of what is likely the most traumatic and terrifying mental experience a human being can ever endure there is no rational reason hell not even a poorly supported emotional irrational reason for metaphorically playing russian roulette with a semiautomatic and yet here i sit staring down the maw of pathological chronic psychosis and twenty feet away on the counter lies an unfilled prescription dated sometime in januaryid be lying if i told you that i dont love every minute of it there is a thrill to flirting with this that is unlike any adrenaline addiction in the world the fact of the matter is i look forward to it there is no drug that can touch this words flow i cant write like this normally code flows too my most inspired and beautiful creations are spawned from the primordial ooze of psychological pandemonium i write my best music at times like thesesure theres irritability short term memory loss all the side effects of chronic sleep deprivation and of course the actual life consequences of all the monumental stupidity one commits when in this state its tough to explain the twelve parallel scars on your forearm for instance i presume its just as tough to explain why you were doing 120mph down the interstate although i have yet to actually be forced to account for that particular idiocybut none of that matters all thats important is riding the high staying blitzed out of your mind wringing every last drop of maniacal pleasure out of the tortured and rapidly fraying rag of your life the stupidity is eclipsed by an allconsuming hedonistic obsession if it feels good do it to obscene excess i dont normally drink much but my liquor supply is dwindling at an alarming rate these days i dont think ive smoked as much in the past five months as i have in the last five days theres some suspiciously fistshaped dents in the walls now which correspond in interesting ways with the occurrence of thirtyhour halo marathon sessions some of those dents are celebratory but mostly theyre the lingering testament to unremembered episodes of blind rage depends on how many games i won and how many i lostif i werent socially dysfunctional and living the middle of the most assbackwards conservative part of the country id probably be treading water right next to hank moody in his proverbial sea of pointless pussy to be honest im not sure if im more annoyed or relieved that im not on a rampant sex binge right now god knows i more or less have substituted testosterone for all my blood at this point probably best to keep the destructive chaos of my problems confined to myself i suppose no sense in ensnaring some poor innocent chain of women in my disintegrating mass of lunacy i daresay they might find the experience worth it but i can only justify that argument by breaking into some truly lurid speculation at what id do with a suitably attractive female and her delicious little body right now and this is sw not some trashy erotic fiction board and in any case im so delusional right now that its probably not true anywaysof course all this raises an important question why am i here in the first place i dont even know if i want help im fairly sure that im running entirely on id at this point and all i really am after is attention ok lets be honest i want some gorgeous young thing to read this and fall hopelessly head over heels for my prose be deeply moved by my emotional plight and make it her dedicated life goal to cure all my worldly ailments by means of frequent raunchy sexbut it felt good to say all this and in a weird sort of way itll feel good to think that someone read it even if nobody really doesbecause right now the anonymous faceless internet seems to offer more in the way of genuine interest and compassion than all the individuals i can name put together im also deep in a rut of ignoring the advice and care of everyone around me anyways as if somehow it only counts if it comes from someone who doesnt know me for real i have no idea if the people in my life actually do give a shit or not although i have to confess that the patterns indicate a gutwrenching trend of them running for the hills as soon as i start getting weird fuck you _person_ by the way youre a lowdown liar and you nearly cost this world a precious life because of it if i could bring my broken heart to wish upon you a greater misfortune than having to live out your life drenched in the guilt of what you did to me i wouldwhen it comes down to it ive always sort of idolized the hollywood image of the battered scarred hero shrouded in bandages and comatose in some anonymous hospital bed its as close as you can get to actually seeing who shows up and who cries at your own funeral i guess i just want the satisfaction of knowing that someone would really be broken up if i decided it was time for an experiment in leadpowered trepanationand hell if the silver screen can be trusted we all know that the ladies dig guys with incurable diseases at least i hope so because that way my sorry ass might actually find someone who gives a fuck somedayand with that i think ive indulged myself enough and certainly probably lost your interest a long time ago anyways so there you have iti feel like a goddamn fixture in this jointmaybe its therapeutic god knows i need the therapy in pretty much any form i can find maybe its just shameless attention whoring im not going to lie its kind of cool to labor under the illusion that someone on this shitty rock cares about you for a few hours then of course i remember that its just reddit and nobody hear really knows anything about me and i can curl back up into the warm comfort of my eternal selfloathing and despairdont let me stop you of course when you say nice things about me both of us feel better you probably moreso than me just understand that im going to believe you for all of a fraction of a happy second and then go back to being convinced that the universe would be vastly improved after my removal from ita few days ago i was in here raving up a storm about all kinds of things thats mania for you to be frank i only posted that because i knew that this time was coming i knew that the high would pass and leave in its wake the utter despondency and misery of depression it always happens this wayi wanted to get back in the habit of lurking around sw because i knew that sooner or later the piper would come round with his smartly printed invoice and demand his due well bitch didnt just come for the rent money bitch brought the pimp and the posse i used to think the mafia had some great lienless collection methods kneecapping comes to mind but this crowd could make _person_ happily proclaim to be an atheistin short i find myself back in the place ive visited so many times before back in that delectable little spot that subsumes all light and hope in a way that black just cant begin to describe my trusty _person_ knife is waiting for me across the room begging in a sensuous sort of way to reignite our old passions and spill that blood just one more time and in all fairness the scars _are_ starting to fade a bit and i wouldnt want them to get lonelyknives are for amateurs though why lay around in a puddle of your own neglect and hatred waiting for someone to inevitably notice and call 911 why give fate the chance to fuck you over one last time and deprive you of the one thing that would satisfyi believe in doing things once and doing them right dont leave room for questions or mistakes or second thoughtsall i really want to know is whether or not id have the chance to see the flash hear the sound feel the rapid exit of brain from cranium as the bullet wends its oblivious way into the wall behind me id be rather disappointed if the lights just went out with no fanfaremy only regret would be that i wouldnt live long enough to really absorb the understanding of what it means to be deadtheres a practical dilemma of course and that is not so much the selection of the _type_ of tool but which _particular_ one my 9mm pistol is a beautiful piece of art and would make a very ergonomic albeit somewhat cliche means of settling matters but i certainly dont want to neglect the assault rifle either its an elegant and powerful creation all its own and bears more than a little sentimental valuemy most difficult choice right now involves determining which of my weapons i want to disappoint by _not_ choosing it to silence the maelstrom of agony too bad im not coordinated enough to shoot myself with both at the same timeyoure already preparing the same trite old response that gets recycled like so much newspaper around here dont do it theres good in the world stuff thats worth living for it would hurt too many people more than one might imagine taking yourself from this realm would constitute a tragic loss for us all_person_im a gangrenous limb better to be amputated and save the innocent remainder of the body from inevitable death by infection than to prolong the agony and pain over a little bit of sentimental attachment cauterization is ugly but ultimately it spares that which remains from a fate worse than a scarif there really is good in the world keep it for yourselves at least that way someone will be able to enjoy it im beyond that in the rare cases when something good has been within my grasp ive stopped at nothing to banish it from my presence with as much haste and hate as i can musterim in the final stages of negotiation for a new job double the salary ridiculous benefits vastly improved career prospects i have good friends good people a family nice car own a house no outstanding debt aside from the mortgage and no substantial criminal record nothing to run from nothing to bury and hope to never revisit by most standards im pretty successfulits wastedi hate all of it i resent everyone and the few people crazy or genuinely decent enough to get involved in my life are inevitably told to go die in a fire because im terrified of anyone actually caring about me such a delicious contradiction the only thing i want is to feel like i matter to someone and yet ill stop at nothing to make myself as onerous and hateful as i can i refuse to let anyone provide the one thing that would do me any goodi crave the involvement of the perfect woman someone to be strong for me when i cannot be strong for myself to care and listen and advise and just exist when those things are necessary i ache for someone i can cherish for her inner and outer beauty for all the things that make us so perfect and imperfect and irredeemable and invaluable as human beings and i am terrified for the inescapable moment when i would lie awake at night arms around her smelling the hint of recently visited surf on her midnight hair look into those eyes like pine needles through morning fog and hate her for loving meim beyond help beyond hope and i want to be told that i am wrong so i can laugh at your hollow consolation and retreat ever further into the certainty of my worthlessnessi will captivate and exploit every precious second of your attention that i possibly can by weaving words in the only way i know how and i will loathe you for listening to my pretentious drivel i will spend hours polishing every last turn of phrase so i can detest you for being impressed by my oratory i will spill out every drop of my soul onto the unfeeling tarmac and mock you for empathetically trying to turn the stains back into a person who once was wholei will post a litany of disgusting prose to suicidewatch and i will reject and deflect every response i get knowing that every best attempt at helping me will serve only to make me more convinced that i am beyond any helpand i will secretly hope that none of that will stop youbecause i will secretly hope that one of you will find it in you to stop meabout ten feet away in my closet theres an alluring collection of items that promises to solve everything the key players include one ar15 carbine in a hardshell carrying case four polymer magazines and twelve rounds of 556 fmj ammunition the promise is a lie but it doesnt matter how many times you tell yourself its a lie if you still want to believe iti could disassemble and reassemble that rifle blindfolded and in my sleep i can land a ten shot group in an area the size of a quarter at twentyfive yards even without the assistance of the 9power scope mounted on the upper rail at a time when it feels like ive lost the mental capacity to do even menial tasks when it takes more effort than i can summon just to change my socks when i have no clarity to see even a few minutes into the future this is all the comfort i have i know that no matter how far my mind may be gone how ruined and exhausted and broken my body may become i will still have what it takes to make one final shot at point blank rangei have watched my life deteriorate rapidly over the past few weeks all the patterns are there so ingrained and familiar that i plunge into them unconsciously utterly unaware of the progression until after its too late the medication has run out and i made no effort to secure a fresh prescription the bills are piling up and the collections agencies have flooded my inbound calls list on my cell phone ive carefully dismantled the very few supporting relationships i have left alienating and driving away everyone who might be around to interfere with the decline everyone has been carefully manipulated and misdirected until they look the other way even those who should know the warning signs are oblivious because ive meticulously concealed the reality of the situation or sometimes outright lied about it to divert their attentionthis is not my first rodeo ive warred with myself for the better part of 14 years always swinging back and forth between wanting to be ok and wanting to plant a knife in my jugular ive spent countless nights holding those knives lying paralyzed on the floor and scrounging for any last ounce of resistance even as i tell myself over and over that all i want is to be done with the whole thing sometimes ill pick one of my guns take it apart clean it put it back together rinse repeat hours of monotonous flirtation with the thing i want to do most and the thing i want above all to never doit was supposed to get better new treatments new doctors new home new job fresh starts on all fronts opportunities to succeed where ive destroyed myself before i have no reason to want to quit life no horrible past no guilty conscience no unspeakable trauma i have no excuse for feeling this knowing that it makes no sense does nothing to calm the screaming agony that insists that i do not belong here knowing that it makes no sense simply removes all hope of finding a way to make life worth hanging on toabove all else im tired tired of fighting resisting hoping tired of clutching at the ribbons of the life im not even sure i want to keep tired of spending one day stubbornly surviving and the next day slicing new grooves into my arms tired of inwardly craving someone anyone to come along and care while outwardly weaving a revolting image of someone that nobody could ever bring themselves to care about tired of feeling like i shouldnt bother reaching out for help because i dont deserve to be helpedas with so many times before being tired will probably be my salvation i will fall asleep before i find the energy to accomplish my exit and then i will feel even worse for failing for crying wolf for wasting the time and concern and attention of anyone who happens to look in at the right moment i will be back at work pretending nothing is wrong at home curled up on the floor in a dark room alone with my twisted mind here begging for something i cant even name and knowing that in all likelihood i will reject whatever is offeredi cant ignore the problem i hate the thought of eroding away in an anonymous hospital im not even sure i want to be ok anymore i want out and i have the ticket but i dont have the crucial piece of whatever it is that would let me cash it insometimes i feel pain sometimes i feel anger sometimes i feel loneliness or guilt or regret or whatever else but this time all i feel is desperation and deep disgust i hate my reality and i hate myself for allowing it to become real i hate staying alive and i hate the thought of being gonei am a prisoner of my own mind and the warden is cruelim skeptical that anyone will read all of this or bother to be moved on my behalf or bother to reply even just to say that someones paying attention i dont feel like im worth any of that i dont know what will happen what i will do how i will feel if and when i wake up tomorrow i dont even know if i want this to improvei dont know if i will hate myself more for posting this or for deleting it and simply suffering in silence and anonymityi am so lost in all of this i will probably tell you that i dont want your helpplease dont listenive confessed an awful lot here in the past _person_ things that ive never managed to elucidate anywhere else told whole truths instead of the carefully manipulated halflies that everyone else hears revealed things that no one who knows me could even imagine and yet theres so much more that remains unsaid so many things concealed or only barely hinted atpart of that is because i dont even want to confront the truth myself let alone betray any hint of that truth to anyone else i dont really know why maybe its embarrassment maybe its pride maybe its just another way to pretend that everything isnt as totally fucked up as it really is but as things slide one more time into the gnawing dark i have nothing left to lose no reason to continue with the charade no excuse to cower behind some facade of invented strengthmaybe by writing this i can accept what im so afraid of facing maybe ill be proven wrong in a few days it wont matter either waythe truth is im not strong im not brave im not a survivor every time i go through this i go a little bit further every time i hurtle back down into the lightless abyss i want it to sting a little bit more i dont want the pain to stop anymore i dont want the demon that whispers in my own voice to be silenced i want to succumb to give in to fold under the weight of all the dark things that have crowded out any semblance of hopethere are no words to communicate the depth of aloneness anyone who could have coined those words is already too far gone to carry them back to the realm of expression and understanding i will follow them soon beyond the shapeless border that permits no reentry and then i too will be forever cut off from the chance to return to the place where real people live forever without a means to share with any clarity what i have seen so i will use the only words i have available and hope that somehow they might capture some essence of the truth i cant imagine what good it could do but perhaps i will rest easier knowing that ive done all i could to explain myself i know that no matter what i say nobody will really understand why nobody will be able to accept the simplicity of the decision maybe thats a good thing no one should have to quietly shrug away the bitterness of this so even if no one truly understands at least i wont be able to blame myself for not telling themi moved more than a dozen times growing up i dont understand the concept of home that people talk about the word has no meaning to me the building i live in is just a convenient location to sleep in the area i occupy is just another faceless abstraction it could be anywhere it could be nowhere it wouldnt matter my family is not close the only person i know the closest thing i have to the concept of a friend is a guy ive known since first grade hes a lying selfish inattentive abusive son of a bitch most of the time i think his presence in my life does more harm than goodbut in an existence dominated by constant and wildly uncontrollable change hes a tiny sliver of stability for a long time i wanted something anything to be stable so desperately that i repeatedly looked the other way for all the years of mistreatment neglect and cruelty the irony is that i cant even go to him with these problems i despise him resent him and more often than not wish i could bring myself to let go of that island of certainty whats the point of being sure of something when its always negativeit shouldnt be much of a surprise that im very bad at interacting with people nobody knows that because what i am good at is putting on a hell of a convincing show most people think im friendly interesting outgoing funny all they know of me is an act i play the role of the likable guy thats thoroughly ok and i play it well but i am not and never have been that personi spent the day goofing off and joking with my coworkers about how its friday and in a few hours we can go get a couple drinks and blow off steam for the weekend i spent the day fantasizing about going home not to break out the scotch and watch some tv and unwind but to lock myself in a dark room and suffer more i used to enjoy my job the last few days i see it only as a way to burn a few hours until i can come back to my cave of pain and wallow in the catastrophic shit that has blocked out everythingfor many years i dreamed of romance i wanted to meet someone who i could share life with someone who could be a constant and help me establish the roots ive never had as things worsened i still had many of the same desires but it was less about stability and certainty and more about empathy i just wanted someone who would always be there when i got home someone who i could count on to smile gently and tell me everythings ok someone to cry alongside me in the middle of the night when i lay awake in an exhausted heap of agony someone to hide the knives and guns and household toxic chemicals someone to be strong and carry me when my own strength gave outnow i am conflicted just imagining putting someone through that makes me feel guilty at times i dont feel like i deserve that kind of care other times i dont believe that anyone would willingly offer it i certainly could never ask anyone to commit themselves to a life of that kind of hell dealing with me day in and day out and i could never get close to anyone without telling her the truth of what i am its bad enough that every outward facet of my life is a lie i couldnt live with myself if i duped some poor innocent soul into getting tangled up in my worldtheres still a lot of appeal in the idea every night in the long moments between wakefulness and sleep i can almost pretend that shes there almost imagine the reassuring warmth of her curled up beside me almost smell the hints of her almost hear her whisper that she loves me that nothing can stop us that i have a reason to livealmostsome nights i fall asleep this way some nights i carry on my helpless fantasy in a warped maze of halfcoherent dreams every night i wake up again and realize that all of it is in my head that my deluded cravings are so far from reality that they may as well join the ranks of the hallucinations and voices and grandiose obsessions sometimes i will spend interminable hours broken down to tears most of the time im just numb to the ludicrousness of it all the pathetic desperate plea for something i know i will never havewhen im really truly honest with myself i know id never accept it even if it were offered to memy purpose in this world is to hurt and to hurt alone no mountain of reasoning or persuasion will convince me that i am wrong i may pretend to change my mind for a time may even allow some fraction of my mind to embrace the notion but in the sturdiest foundation of my soul i will never believe that i could be loved not like thatwhat probably hurts the worst is knowing how much of a despicable idiot child i must sound like even to say this so naive so ignorant so obsessed with something trivial and trite so bound by the knots of ugly selfloathing and selfpity and deniala close runner up though is being told that im wrong happy people find it so damnably easy to promise that things get better that you can find what you truly want in life that itll be ok stuck up in their insular spotless ivory towers of not being fucked up and broken and ruined and worthless incapable of saying anything with meaning or believability good intentions mean nothing no matter how genuine they can reach out as hard as they like but they will never be able to touch the reality of my situation to do that you have to be down here in the dark and the mud and the blood and the hurtshes just a myth a fantasy an idea that once gave me something to look for and some reason to keep tolerating the world for another day now shes just an untruth that serves only to torment me more with the thought of what i cannot and will not have the only purpose she serves is an obstacle as long as she haunts me i will never be free to leave this place in peace until i kill her i cannot kill myselfi feel that ive stopped making sense that ive rambled too long in selfindulgent tripe that the sheer absurdity of what i have said cannot possibly merit any kind of response i know how ridiculous and stupid and empty all of this isbut its what i feel and its the truth its all i have left im not asking for sympathy or understanding or caring or anything really im doing this for myself because i will never be able to move on if i cannot admit the facts that sit before mei dont know what comes next i dont know if ill feel better later or worse if ill finally make good on the years of threats or if ill miraculously dredge up yet another feeble excuse to keep on goingbut i will fall asleep soon drained and exhausted and bereft of any energy to deal with this any more for today tonight i will sleep aloneand probably every other night tooits been a long time since ive wanted to drive a blade into my own fleshthe sensations return long lost yet still familiar and oddly comfortable like an old jacket dug out of the back of a dusty closet everything is paradoxically darker than it should be nothing is enjoyable anymore all i want to do is sleep until the discomfort goes away but i find myself battling an increasingly resilient case of insomniai know this will never stop my choices are either to live with the periodic suffering for the rest of my miserable existence or to put an end to all of it and just rest forever and judging by where im posting right now it should be obvious that the latter is beginning to win the mental votemy outward daily life is a carefully crafted sculpture of lies designed to hide the reality of my world from everyone sometimes even from myself tonight the concealment is broken perhaps not from anyone else but i cant stay in denial any longer i hurt deeply and fundamentally and pretending that it will just go away is going to solve nothingalienation and loneliness are essential ingredients in my world it couldnt exist without them and yet those very things are part of what drags my mind back into the downward spiral of yet another depressive episode i cant tell people the truth ive done that before with disastrous results but i need _someone_ to know someone besides the doctors visited stealthily to avoid tipping off anyone else someone besides the internet strangers begged incessantly for support without resultsi stood on my porch this afternoon burning through a countless number of cigarettes for lack of anything useful to do with myself and wondered what the fuck im even trying forits all just materialistic horseshit and i dont care about any of it the job the hobbies the recreation the wasteful endless hours of meaningless idiocy that everyone seems content to call life theres no goddamn point i have no reason to do it no investment in any of it so what if some of it is occasionally fun so what if its lucrative so what if society expects itfuck all of it and fuck everyone who thinks it mattersi know what i really want what would give me something to hang on _for_ what would provide desperately needed pause before pulling the trigger and violently redistributing my brain across the walls i know this and i know i will never allow myself to have it because i am terrified because i am weak because i have no hope and no will to try to attain it and because the notion that anyone would stand by and provide it is a fucking lieim too old broken hopeless unappealing repulsive lazy unmotivated disenfranchised bitter scarred angry mistrustful cynical deceitful cancerousnobody will ever give a shit because i refuse to let themit doesnt get better it just happens again there isnt anything worth living for because theres nothing worth dying for except for the beckoning call of permanent peace maybe some people would be hurt or surprised or inconvenienced or mildly distracted who the hell knows who the hell cares those people have some mystical genetic ability to ignore the fucked up nature of the universe and chug along as if happiness was a real thing on a constant delusional treadmill of chasing the _person_ and the next pay raise and the bigger car and those people can collectively get fucked and diefuck your comforting fuck your cajoling fuck your pleas fuck your sympathy and fuck youim going to go drink the last of the bourbon i have in the house smoke my last two cigarettes and if i have the presence of mind after all that im going to put a stop to this shitthe rollercoaster may not be done with me but im done with the rollercoaster to hell with waiting for the end im jumping off,-7376.94,2869.4,2944.25,0.0,9.26,59.0
218,21174,going into my last year in high schools been tough for about the past 6 years the thought of killing myself has become more and more realistic starting off with the bad experiences would probably be a start i guess when i was about 5 until the time i was about 7 i was sexually abused by an older family friend i had know what was going on the entire time and had developed a bit of a distrust to people at that point and have been shy since that day its been pretty scaring for me to have to not open up to people really until nowfast forwarding a couple years constantly being bullied all throughout elementaryjunior high school even the start of high school i never felt quite in with the crowd and it made me distrust people more become depressed and become pissed off with the world that i was living in i took to being friends with a few select people and constantly being an ass to others due to the fact that i knew they were just trying to piss me off the situation at home was also very bad the only one in my household whom actually treated me with decency was my brother whom to this day i have the best relationship with out of my entire family my parents were very violent and would constantly yellbeat me sometimes almost to the point of hospitalizationdeath i always hated living at home and vowed to either kill myselfwhich i have attempted many times before couldnt follow through with it or just live my life through and just move out asap and try to live life after my parents getting a divorce things got much better for the beatingsviolence mainly due to the huge custody battle my parents were in they tried to be as nice as possible and get me whatever i wantedfor the most part yet all i wanted was an apology for their actions when i was younger and to truly accept me as their son neither would listen and continued to be completely ignorant to settle the whole custody arrangement my parents thought it would be a good idea for me to go see a counselor to try to sort out my feelings during one of the counselor meetings we were discussing a lot of things in the past with arguments and how unfair my parents were my dad lied out his ass and tried to make him look like he was the victim the entire time yet my mom had openly apologized for all the things she did and how she was wrong to take out her stress on us it was pretty much then that i moved in permanently with my mom that was about 2 years ago since then i had torn my acl as well as causing major meniscus damage resulting in not being able to be active for the past year and a half a very painful surgery long term physiotherapy as well as depression i still cannot run properly or even play sports which was a big part of my life its been very rough for me this past year and i fear for the worst when it comes to suicide i feel as though i am alone in my feelings although i know others go through the same things daily,-477.64,220.5,228.52,0.0,8.27,56.0

236,24226,four years ago i was 19 and i was living 10 hours away from all of my family and friend i wish in my freshman year of college and was stretching myself thin at the time this took place i was taking 6 classes and was involved in the theatre so my time was limited i had been battling with depression for years but never told anyone about it i felt that i had nothing to be depressed about i had a good family a nice place to live my intelligence and a small group of good friends but i never felt like i really connected to people i went so far away to school to remake myself in hopes that it would helpit didntone night in october i had enough i was done nothing really set this off i had one friend and i was dating someone at the time but i didnt see the point in going on my roommate was gone i lived in a dorm and we shared a room so i proceeded to down a bottle of pills i laid down thinking well this is it and went to sleep4 hours later i woke up and ran to the bathroom i spent the next 6 hours with my head in a toilet once morning hit about 8am i texted my boyfriend and told him i was sick and he called campus police who drove me to the hospital i was checked in and when they asked what happened i told them i blacked out i must have lied well enough in that they didnt think it was a suicide attempt they made me drink this foul tasting stuff to help my liver filter out the pills and the next day i was back at my dorm about 5 hours later they called and said poison control said i needed to come back in for more medication i was in for another night receiving medication and getting my blood drawn to test my liver once i was cleared i was out of the hospital and back to my dorm a few weeks later i told my friend and boyfriend what really happened and they urged me to get helpi went to the colleges counseling center after a few other people had told me they wouldnt push drugs i was very against them i went and filled out a ton of forms that i thought were completely idioticafter she read the forms she said that she wasnt trained to handle cases like mine and referred me to a psychiatrist i went to meet with him 3 days later and he diagnosed me with major depression he said that while talking would help my problems were chemical and that i needed medication after a couple weeks of resisting the meds i relented and got the prescription filled my initial dose screwed me up i was irritable anxious and it made my depression much worse he said that if i was having any running thoughts i was or suicidal ideas i was to call him asap so i did he said to go the hospital and let them know who he was and who i was they immediately put me on suicide watch but because i wasnt manic or outofcontrol they didnt lock me in the room they let me sleep there and the next morning they put me on a gurney and strapped me downthe next thing i know im being transported to a mental health facility about an hour an a half away i was there for 3 days because i was 19 i was legally an adult and they put me with all of the adults in the center emotionally i was not an adult at all i was mostly with drug addicts but we did see a few clinically insane people my first day i cried i was considered a risk to myself so i couldnt check myself out and i had a major panic attack when they told me i couldnt leavethe second day i played the game i did what they wanted me to doi went to group meetings i listened to what the doctors and nurses said but something odd happened as i was playing along i realized things were actually helping the stupid activities were actually making me feel better im smart enough to know what they were doing so i thought i was above it but it workedtwo days later i was released and sent back to school i went back to the psychiatrist and yelled at him a bit for telling me to go to the hospital and at the end of my rant i cried and thanked him he lowered the dose on my meds and that stopped the problems i was havingflash forward 4 years later im still on my medsive attempted to go off them or change them but nothing works as well as they do and without them i go back to being the depressed teenager i wasim now married and have 1 year old twin girls i do worry about what my girls are going to think about me needing medication to be a normal human being but ill cross that bridge when i come to iti dont believe meds are always the answer and i dont believe that everyone should go spend a few days in a psych ward but it worked for me hopefully every one of you will realize that there is something out there for you please dont do what i did its the only thing in my life im happy i failed at take the lesson i had to learn the hard way and apply it to your lifetldr just read it,-880.6,375.3,386.49,0.0,6.94,55.0

241,25368,okay well i dont really like talking about myself but since you all are nice enough to read this i guess ill share some personal things with you guysi dont know how to really start but i guess ill try by explaining my various issuesthe number one issue for my depression is that i hate myself so in other words my low selfesteem i look in the mirror and see the reflection and im just disgusted im ugly fat stupid and their is no one who could ever like a person like meive cut for the past four years of my life off and on it has gotten significantly worse these past two years though i used to cut maybe once of twice a week and now its almost everydayi think about killing myself everyday every morning when i wakeup if something bad happens during the day and before i go to bed before i fall asleep at night i pray that i wont wakeup in the morning that all the pain and all the suffering will be over and ill be gone the people in my life will move on and act as if i was never here no one will care and everyones lives will be a lot easier my parents my few _person_ you can even call them that and my boyfriend ive had multiple attempts aswell planned it all out left suicide notes ready to do it but well as you can see unfortunately im still alivemy number two reason is my mothershe blames me for all the stress in her lifeshe blames me for things that happen at her office like if one of her employees fuck up shell compare me to them and say that im just like themshe calls me stupid lazy worthless and that ill never amount to anything in lifeif she doesnt like the clothes that im wearing shell tell me i look like a prostituteshe blames me for her having _person_ im sorry i fucking shoved sugar down your throatthe number three reason is that my parents put a lot of restrictions on me im 18 and im not allowed to go anywhere even if i want to go see a movie or go for coffee with one of my friends i have to ask for permission which is pointless because they always say no anywaysi get no independence i get no life they suffocate me i have to work in their office i am not allowed to get any other job this is so they can keep an eye on me and see what i am doing at all times i am not allowed to take my cell phone to work or keep it in my room when i get home i forgot to mention that i pay for this phone myselfmy number four reason is my boyfriend i care and love him a lot so dont get me wrong or anything but i just feel like im always doing something wrong in our relationship or im stressing him out with all my drama i just feel like he wants to breakup with me he constantly tells me that this is not the case and that he does not want a breakup i just feel like he deserves someone better than me someone whos smarter prettier and will give him everything he wantsneeds in a relationshipi just dont know what to do with my life anymore i dont know where im going or what is going to happen to me im really scaredhey guys so this is the original post _url_ its taken me three months or so to work up the courage and actually see someone but today i finally had my first appointment with my psychiatrist i can honestly say that i felt so good

starting me on viibryd which is like lexaprodoes anyone know about this medication if so what are your comments about itso this is an update on how my life is going now original post is from about 5 months ago _url_ first statement ill start off by saying is that i have finally been diagnosed with major _person_ aswell as severe anxiety and i might have addupdate i havent cut for the past few months nowi used to think about killing myself everyday every morning when i wokeup if something bad happened during the day and before i went to bed before i fell asleep at night i would pray that i wouldnt wakeup in the morning i just wanted all the pain and all the suffering to be over and id be gone from the world the people in my life would move on and act as if i was never there no one would care and everyones lives would be a lot easier my parents my few _person_ you can even call them that and my boyfriend ive had multiple attempts aswell planned it all out left suicide notes ready to do it but well as you can see unfortunately im still aliveupdate about 2 weeks ago i jumped out of my 2nd story bedroom window im okay though i wanted to die but i couldnt get up higher my left ankles sprained but everything else is fine my depression medication _person_ is working really well and i love my anxiety medication _person_ its fucking amazing i feel so calm and at piece with my surroundings and i dont get tense anxious or have any racing thoughts so its great dboyfriend and i brokeup but im doing really well we broke up about 2 months ago and the great part is is that hes

242,25479,my marriage is recovering but i still feel lower than worthless despite any improvement reassurance or promise i still cant stop feeling that my wife valued her relationship with someone she met four times over our eight year relationship i still think every night about how after i told her i wanted to end it and didnt want to or trust myself to be alone that she left me to see himi understand intrusive thoughts better than most but knowing that part of her would be happy if i was gone robs me of any motivation to get better to know that im no longer attractive to her that she would essentially decide our lives together or apart on a coin flip leaves me feeling completely abandoned by the only person ive ever loved this much she made me promise i wouldnt do it and i thought it was because she cared now i just feel like she doesnt want to deal with the guilt and i dont know if thats a good enough reason to keep my promise there are only two people i feel even care about me anymore one is himself suicidal and im trying to keep him alive because i know what he has to offer to the world and it is so much more than i could the other is like a little sister but i am a protector i dont want to burden her with thisi dont even know why im writing this i guess just so if or when i follow through someone will check my phone read my post history and let them know,-179.23,105.8,110.42,0.0,7.69,58.0
243,25499,i cant do this any more i dont even know why if im being entirely honest i just got out of hospital for depression a week ago and im already suicidal again got out feeling on top of the world and now im back down at the bottom normally going into hospital gets me a few months of happiness before i end up back in there but now now i cant even get a full week what the hell is the point any more my anxiety is so intense that i cant even make it out the door for anything more than a walk each day and i can barely do that because im too out of shape to do anything more than 2km the anxiety is also stopping me from even attending outpatients at the hospital so fuck that avenue too i cant even get support from professionals because im too damn nervous to get out the door and catch a train down thereim just sick of it sick of feeling like a nohoper whos gonna be stuck living off welfare for the rest of his life because of the anxiety its considered bad enough that im on a disability pension sick of not being able to study because i have fuck all concentration sick of not being able to get a girlfriend or even new friends because i cant leave the house im just sick of lifethe only thing thats making me hesitate is the fact that my mother suffers from depression as well and i worry that i may tip her over the edge if i do anything same goes for my best friend but that motivation to keep living is getting thinner and thinner i dont even know if i want to be persuaded but i figure that for their sake i should tryugh im posting here because i dont know who else to turn to i have friends who know about my depression and are supportive as well as family but if i tell them how close i am to taking all those pills chances are ill be back in hospital within a week and ill have the pills taken away from me and hidden thats the last thing i want to happen right now because i feel like the only actual option i have in my life right now is that of suicide i dont want that one option to be taken away from me even if i choose not to commit suicide i at least want to be able to do it if i should change my mind later so i really dont want to tell my friends or family any of thisthing is though my parents are gone at the moment so im alone in the house and my pills are accessible to me for the first time in about a year normally my mum just hands out my daily doses and thats all i get the fact that i can finally actually overdose like ive been considering for so long its so hard for me to resist right nowim scared and i dont know what to do its not the thought of death that scares me its the thought that if i act on these thoughts itd tear my family apart and i dont want to be responsible for thatbut on the other hand im so sick of being so anxious all the goddamn time always being alone please help somebody i dont even know what i want but please helpi hesitate to even write this post because it reeks of attentionseeking to write a suicide post 2 months before im even planning to do it but i guess i want to be talked out of it for the sake of my familyive finally figured out my method ive figured out what im writing in my note how and when in the day im going to do it to minimize chances of being discovered basically im just sick to death hah of all the anxiety and depression of being in and out of hospital i feel like a waste of space on this planet not contributing anything to society just taking a disability pension every fortnight because of severe anxiety that stops me functioning properly and being able to live a halfway decent lifei dont want to commit suicide mainly because of my family who i know will be devastated by it especially because my mum already suffers from depression herself but frankly im just sick of it i figure ill wait until february mainly so i can last through christmas my mother loves christmas so i dont want to forever have that time of year affiliated with my death for her and im planning to see my dad in another state one last time before i go so that rules out the first half of january then im going back into hospital in the first half of feb for an anxiety and depression program which quite frankly i cant see working but ill give it one last shot and if it doesnt work i guess ill end it once and for all just wanted to get that off my chest ive been wanting to tell somebody for a couple of weeks now but anybody i know in real life would just try to put me in hospital again which i really dont want thanks for reading anybody who does,-825.79,354.3,365.1,0.0,7.23,58.0

253,26474,im a loser i just tried to kill myself by lighting a charcoal bbq in my bathroom but then as i lay there i thought about how all my neighbours were home and i realized that i did not want to risk poisoning them or setting the house on fire so now i will have to find a more isolated place im thinking my car but the bbq is so large that i will probably start the car on fire not that i care about me or my car i just dont want to harm other people or their propertyim stupid theres nothing really wrong with me i was never beaten or molested ive never been robbed no one close to me has died from unnatural causes and yet life to me sucks its pure bleakness with short periods of mild happinessi dont talk much i like work because i can do task oriented conversations but chitchat and intimacy i cant doim very cold and distant ive never had friends not even when i was a kid im very reclusive i hate myself so much i wish i would just grow up but i find that hard to do im improving but ive wasted so much of my lifei lost my job ive been such a shit over the past several months that when i quit again my bosses just let me goim very selfinvolved people tire of me quickly because i can never think of anything but me and my stupid problems which wouldnt be problems if i would just grow upim unhappy with myself because im not smart or motivated i want to be really good at math but a few days ago i sat down to once again attempt to learn determinants but something was gone ive never had much mental energy but something was different those few days ago and now i truly feel i have no hope to be good at mathi want to be smart and if i cant be smart id rather be dead im interested in robots engineering philosophy languages all sorts of stuff but i know none of it ive failed college twice and its just cause i can never sit my ass down and get shit donei hate myself please tell me im a loser and give suggestions on where i can go to kill myself with co poisoning without danger to othersive been doing a lot of thinking and ultimately ive come to realize what my fundamental problem is its my procrastination ive procrastinated the entire first 28 years of my life awayive been thinking about it a whole lot and ive come to realize that i despair of ever fixing the issue for starters its hard to get people to take me seriously their advice almost always ends up being well you just have to try harderim really sorry but i cant fix this and im also unwilling to spend the rest of my life being the guy i am so unless i find some way of effecting immediate changes in my procrastination habits i will be killing myself in the next few daysi have chosen a new location where starting the place on fire will not be a problem i anticipate that i will be successful this time around if i wind up fucked up i do not carei wish i did not have to cause anyone pain if i could erase all memory of me so that people didnt know i was around to begin with i would do it i am sorry to be such an asshole and a fuck upi just tried to kill myself by tying shoelaces around my throat and then twisting them tight with a pen but i just couldnt go through with it this is my third failed attempt in two months im beginning to think that the reason i should live is because i cant follow through on my attemptsi will be contacting mental health and setting up for counselling im really unhappy about this i just want to dieonly this time its goodbye i tried to strangle myself again today and made it further than last time i either put the laces too high or didnt go tight enough because i was still able to pump blood fine except for when i gulped then my adams apple pulled the laces really tight and i could definitely feel like that was strangling meoh well lesson for next timeive decided to throw everything away and go be homeless for a time ive got to try something new because i just cant keep going on like thisso im sorry sw you guys were some of the best people ive met so far i really regret that i cannot be here for you anymoreedit well im back or more precisely i never left i missed the bus i was going to take because it took longer to get to the depot than i thought the next bus was at 10 pm i waited i got bored i went walking it was really beautiful out the wind was warm and gentle it was sunny and there were trees that were starting to bud it felt like spring and it was really calm and soothing the kind of moment you can live fori decided that i can always be homeless later its probably going to happen anyway because ive not had much luck finding a job might as well take advantage of a good situation for as long as one cannormally i would put something in here about seeking help but to be honest im not going to ive always resisted going to the counsellors even if i do manage to get myself there i always stop going after awhile there isnt really any reason for it its just an impulse that ive not managed to resist i have little discipline or willpowerthough part of it is this idea that the healthcare system is overburdened and that my problems seem so little and stupid compared to those in the hospital it seems right to just manage as best as i cani was thinking about it a lot last night and i think another reason is that maybe i like a little drama in my life there is so much pludging through day after day that i feel a little crazy after awhile i think i want to scream and storm that ive been holding these things in for a whole lifetime and have never had an outlet and it always comes out eventually somehow doesnt itso im still here i will do my best to grow and to listen to others i will study some philosophy in the hopes of distilling some wisdom useful to me i will continue to program and study math because it makes my mind sharperi think i grew a little a bit i think im a little stronger somebody posted a quote from micheal jordan about how he succeeds because he repeatedly fails and i think im ready for thati have missed more than 9000 shots in my career i have lost almost 300 games on 26 occasions i have been entrusted to take the game winning shot and missed and i have failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why i succeedi offered to be available to someone for private conversation it went ok at first but after awhile i found i had to take more and more of the leading of the conversation which became harder as time went by eventually i revealed my difficulty which upset him i think because it made him feel like he was being a burden on me or because i made him feel pressured so now he isnt talking to me anymoreive decided to stop posting i want to be here to be of assistance but i really dont know what to say to you to be helpfuli havent been here as much as i wanted to lately but i was struck with a realization a couple days ago that even though i havent been here ive still been there for two people i write every few days just to say hithis is probably the greatest part of sw to meet someone who feels the same way and who will let you just talk without judging youi started out in sw wanting to give advice but ive learned from my two friends that neither of them wants advice they just want someone they can be honest withi just wanted to let people know this because it is invisible advice giving is the most prominent part of sw but not the best parti tried to kill myself two months ago via carbon monoxide poisoning i have been in the pysch ward for two months it was ok it was highly routine the nurses were really niceit was of value because it gave me a huge amount of time to think but it didnt have much of an effect on me i feel that im still weak and eventually i will be suicidal againbut for the time being i am excited about a plan to pay off debt and then return to school to become an engineer or someone who works with robots ill be 3335 when i return i was wondering what people thought of thatbut anyways i will be hanging out here and rdepression again it might be a couple days because i have to do some getting life in order but i look forward to talking to you guys again and hope to be a source of support again in addition to occasionally needing iti am thinking about getting a tattoo across my chest that says do not treat so that if i ever arrive dying at the hospital they might just let me probably not but at least my wishes would be knowni am going to get my organ donor card signed there probably wont be much left of me if im successful in killing myself in the way im thinkingi just cant hack it fuck it you go be a hero im out of herei had a good day yesterday but then suddenly i was opposite i thank you for providing a place for me to just spew my shit it helps to keep me busy until i have had time to calm and become more rationalyou are all really great people and i hope you dont mind being one of my coping mechanisms i hope to be as helpful to others here more oftenit can be really hard to think straight when im under but i always think back to my several attempts and realize that every time i was sincere up until the moment of actually doing it where i would then chicken out i have been using this cowardiance to pull myself out of bad moods and since ive learned to make shifts i dont know how to describe them really except to say that what youre thinking has a big affect on what youre feelinglike this morning i woke up suicidal for the second day in a row and i decided that i would do it right that morning but i was slow to get out of bed and so my mind got to wandering when it somehow ended up on the topic of language processing i spontaneously realized that i didnt want to go just yet i wanted to study this subject a bitbut alas not showing up for work two days in a row after only having the job for a month is bound to have serious consequenceswhats worse is that instead of just calling in sick i phoned and told the boss who hired me that i had depression and that i took poor care of myself and that consequently i was an unreliable worker i havent heard back from him but im confident that ive lost the jobive made my mother mad i told her that i wanted to move out because she was always nagging me and that she didnt like it when i was angry and i just wanted to be left alone when i was like that she had no idea what i was talking about and kept saying so and was really upsetim so pathetic im 30 and ignorant as fuck im only qualified to be a labourer i cant concentrate and stay focused i have no selfdiscipline and ive grown to hate the advice to just apply myselfbut on a more positive note im learning to just live my own lifei remember one time i was doing security work for construction crews working on a bridge keeping people out from under the bridge and such when this lady pulled up to ask some questions about what was going on we ended up doing some small talk and she mentioned something about the number of suicides that had jumped from the bridge something must have happened in the expression on my face because she suddenly exclaimed oh my god youre thinking of suicide then she started laughing like crazy and took off i guess she thought i was a loser and couldnt deal with someone so embarrassingly stupidbut the point is ive learned to just let stuff like that slide so many people are jackasses i cant let them get under my skinim a little stronger now but im still out of control im better at coping but im still deeply ashamed of how little progress ive made as a human beingi dont know what im going to do about my job i think i will go in and talk to my boss in person and maybe that will make a better impression i dont know what im going to do if i dont have the job i will have one last paycheck and its not unreasonable that i could have a new job in a couple weeks though one never knows of course but a big part of me just wants to kill myself and be done with it im afraid of the future and what it will bringso im on the fence here i feel i could handle whats coming but i also feel that whats coming hurts too much and i must avoid it however possible yet i know that i wont go through with my suicide that i will just embarrass myself again yet i might make the attempt anywayim sharing this because it was so bizarre and i was wondering if anyone else has had similar weird experiencesi had insomnia worse than usual last night not a wink of sleep the entire night my thoughts kept churning slowly becoming the angry madness that is my bleak episode until i was ready to not show up to work and instead go jump off a bridgebut then as i was looking at my alarm clock at 708 am i felt a pop and a jolt made me jump in bed and the weird thing was i was suddenly spontaneously fine and ready to go to work i havent even felt tired all dayso im thinking some kind of weird dream what weird experiences like this have others hadim currently in the process of killing myself i have chosen hypothermia as my method it will drop to 20 as the night goes by it is a shit awful way to go but what method isntim feeling sad right now i decided to spend my last day on earth at one of my most favorite places the local university library school was in and so there were a lot of people there i was surprised at the number of good looking women there normally the populations i see are pretty homelyi discovered a bunch of cool books there ones _person_ which is a popular account of how information theory applies in describing people i found proofs and types i found a whole bunch of programming as in math optimization not programming a computer i read the introductory parts of a dynamic programming book and a geometric programming book they were cool i also read one on gravitational waves but it was kind of boring because it was one of those popular books that have too much history and not enough introducing me to the mathso now im feeling sad because even though im not bright i am tenacious i could have spent my life working at the metfab shop and spending my free time at the librarybut it is not to be i cant cope anymore i quit a job because they were going to fire me for being late all the time i cant get up in the mornings i barely eat drugs and wanking have lost their appeal life is just so tiresomeeven though i feel sad i feel that i am making the right decision i cant get through life without the support and forgiveness of all the people around me and that is in short supplyim not asking for help im just saying goodbye to the closest i have to friends i wish i were strongeri spent the last two days trying to freeze myself unfortunately for me we had a brief warm spell today it ended and fuck was it cold i came back and begged my mom to let me come back home she did but she is very angry with mei will talk more later im freezing and veryvery tired just wanted to minimize any worryi quit my job because im a big loser i was going to jump off a bridge today but i chickened out no surprise there i think im going to try homelessness i will stick around my town till winters done then i will move on to a different placei may try freezing myself to death again i almost did it last time but i ended up changing my mind maybe i will succeed this timei have no motivation left why cant there be a simple way of ending iti just threw out everything i own except for the clothes im wearing and my most favorite thing in the whole world this laptopim supposed to be off killing myself but im just so damn reluctanti know what im doing is retarded and yet i do it anywaythe last time i was in the hospital one of the pyschiatrists told me that only i could help myself i cant i know what im doing is stupid and counterproductive and yet i act this way anywayi dont know if i should go to the hospital or not theres the possibility of help but more likely its just going to be more bullshitit forces me to be outside and engaged with reality instead of locked up in my own head even when i did my mandatory walk through the park it was not really outside because i was not disturbed and because i just walked the same path mechanicallyi almost feel like i have a family now dont get me wrong im not naive many of these homeless are criminals and eventually i will probably be mugged but im hanging out with a crazy bunch of people some of whom are a lot of fun i dont feel out of place or inadequate here same reason i like this redditmy monkish nature is starting to express itself i feel as if im living in a monastery im practising acetism giving up all my possessions and being dependent on others for food and shelteri want to become a tutor and a counsellor to these people i want to set up a farm where people who are down and out can go and raise veggies and herbs learn cooking and crafts there would be courses to teach people skills that will help them to get a job so a lot like this shelter but with a garden and better food than donuts for breakfast and pancakes for dinnerive had an insight into religion i like the idea of the greek pantheon but i dont literally claim that there are humanoid beings with great power walking around instead religion is just a very poetic way of expressing truth that is what it should be the ancients should be revered for their wisdom but they are not infallible the poetry needs to update with the timesive grown to like the idea of the tao reality is the tao but what the fuck is it we dont really know we are settlers in a new land slowly figuring our way about that is the truth of the taomy sense of right and wrong has become a little weird this was prompted by a book i was reading loosely based on history there were a lot of executions people being broken on wheels or crushed between sandalwood longs or suspended over a charcoal fire by chains all for stupid reasons like failing to flatter a higher up or writing a poem that unintentionally insults the kingit made me face how brutal the world and humanity is it made me realize that this is a part of life in thinking about this i realized that even though it is natural that predators eat prey and calamities wipe out millions the prey is optimized for defense and the humans are always seeking ways to forecast calamitiesso ive made my peace with suffering i dont seek and i probably wont handle it in a noble stoic manner when it comes but it is part of life while im all for reducing the suffering in the world it will always be there and we have to make our peace with it and move on so we can liveive been reading krishnamurti again what i like most about him is that he never just comes out says anything he forces me to think i tend to get too passive with the ordinary kind of book that just hands out knowledge i think im almost getting what hes sayingso i guess what im trying to say here to those of us that are troubled is that while you are facing a terrible time and it seems like the end of the world it is an opportunity for personal growth and at the end of your struggle you may find a prizethats what i like most about this reddit it is a confrontation of truth to see things as they really are and to figure out what to do about it,-3727.67,1469.3,1509.02,0.0,7.81,55.0

260,26915,first here is some perspective i am 51 years of age and my son 2nd of 3 is 17 he is a senior in high school set to graduate in 4 months our first indications of something wrong came from the school councilor who was acting on advice of my sons friends our second indication was a call from the police at the hospital where he was being cared for after a call for help i dont know if that call was real or a euphemism but there were no physical indications of trauma ive been letting the professionals handle it with 2 notable exceptions after the first incident i had a very rewarding talk with him where he appeared to open up to me i had 1 piece of advice that he appeared to accept which was dont tell anyone what you think they want to hear no one can help you unless you tell the truth and talk about what is truly bothering you the second exception was related to some poor my assessment decisions he was making with respect to dropping a class a school he wouldnt explain his reasoning and his mind was made up i had a discussion about making decisions and explained that it was my role to guide him and if he is refusing to be led then he is forcing me to make decisions based on lack of information and that is never a good thing they second incident resulted in a spat with my wife and i decided to pull back reluctantly that brings us to a month agoso last night he has made arrangements to be with some of his football buddies for a party of sorts he has asked for and received permission to stay over if the situation is such that he wants to hes also borrowed the family van so that he can assume his role of designated driver for anyone who wants to go home and has been drinking yes he was always up front about being at parties where alcohol was available and we trust him or at least there has been no reason not to trust him readdont like it but ive gotta let go sometimeso around 23am he comes home so far so good he had an opportunity to stay over but made a different decision i go back to sleep 6 am i notice my wife is not in bed ill give you more point form as i dont think you want to read whats in my head hes upset coming home he reveals he didnt go to a party instead he met a girl that he met online in a town 1 hour away he got a speeding ticket coming back he knew he was busted but was hoping that i wouldnt find out my wife is beside herself with worrya little more about me when i was 18 and hosting a party at my house i had an incident it involved a loaded shotgun and were it not for the safety i would not be writing this to you as forest gump would say thats all im gonna say about that further my eldest brother is a diagnosed schizophrenic with manic depressive tendencies bipolar and my elder brother has a nondiagnosed inferiority complex that severely interferes with his social skills we are all above average in intelligence but feel undeserving of such it is more of a curse than you know to be able to analyse things so well and self analyse so poorly for the record no one can self analyse well thats a trapi know how i want to proceed but i dont want to bias the responses i am looking for ideas that i may not have thought of that i an incorporate into my plan the responses will dictate my next move please help me to save my son,-565.95,254.4,263.83,0.0,7.57,58.0

273,29020,some days i find it hard to keep going my only motivation is to give people the opportunity to live through medicine i often find myself wondering when the day comes and i save someone will it ever be enough to fill that void in my life it is weird to think that a place of death gave way to a dream the dream that one day i will be a surgeon pippin i didnt think it would end this way gandalf end no the journey doesnt end here death is just another path one that we all must take the grey raincurtain of this world rolls back and all turns to silver glass and then you see it pippin what gandalf see what gandalf white shores and beyond a far green country under a swift sunrise pippin smiling well that isnt so bad gandalf softly no no it isnt i believe that the biggest wrong that any one person can give to another or themselves is regret the regret that enough time wasnt spent or words were not said i assure you that no amount of time or togetherness will prepare you for death how do i know its simple let me tell you can you hear me dad echoed throughout my fathers bare room his fingers were that of ice and his eyes knew that the inevitable was coming hurry the fuck up i shouted at the emt who seemed every bit of shocked as i was as they were grabbing the oxygen tank i rubbed my knuckles against my dads chest and looked into his eyes and a tear was forming a tear of sadness maybe i believe that it was a tear of joy joy knowing that his death would lead to such an astounding goal were going to florida in two weeks just hang in there i whispered to my dad as i got off the bed and looked around i have often read that you can feel when someone has passed its not so much despair as it is relief a relief knowing all the pain confusion and unknown are gone its your entire fault if you wouldnt have divorced dad we would have gotten him here sooner i shouted to my mother the fate of my father was internally known amongst us all but denial had us believing that everything would be fine an hour later we were led back to the consolation room feeling the tension and the amount of grief that was about to hit us i made a joke i cant remember what it was but it brought laughter shortly after the physician walked into the room and said the words we all dreaded the words that are burnt into my mind we pushed all the drugs that we could and got him back shortly but his body burned through them shortly after i am terribly sorry for your loss without thinking i headed right for the door but i was held back and told to not do anything stupid we left the consultation room and went outside i was approached and asked if i would like to see my father i was given a few words of warning that i can leave and remember my dad the way he was the door opened slowly and i felt my blood boil as i saw my fathers lifeless body i turned away quickly looked up and clenched my fists as tight as they could be the _person_ station was in front of me and with tears in my eyes i saw them looking at me a look of heartbreak i wanted so badly to start hitting the station and tell them all to fuck off but i knew that my father would be incredibly displeased with that so i ran outside i could hardly catch my breath as i called my mentor dad is gone after that everything was silent and i felt my mind start to shut down and just carry me without emotion through the next couple days approaching my grandparents at my fathers viewing i was overcome with sadness my eyes started to well with tears and i told them i did the best i could i did the best i could to save my father did i though this is where all of the doubts come creeping in and engrave themselves into your brain and you cant shake them i was sitting in the front of the chapel by myself and i felt a hand on my shoulder i look over and it is my mother she starts talking to me and she says i miss him yeah fucking right is that why you divorced him i told her that she needs to promise me to stop seeing the man she is she asks why so i tell her that dad was the perfect person for her and she fucked it up and needs to be alone like he was she says but he makes me laugh he makes you laugh you have the gall to sit there in front of my dead father and talk about another man like that i storm off later that night i let my anger get the best of me and i wrote my funeral speech i was going to tell everyone that wronged my dad that they could go fuck themselves right there in front of everybody i could hardly sleep that night as i was day dreaming the whole thing i would walk up in front of everybody get on the microphone and praise my father for how amazing he was and in the same breathe make everybody feel like they were the reason he was gone because of how terrible this last year was on him yeah thatll help me cope right its morning finally today is the day that i will tell them all off they all were shit to him and they should all see what they have done i walked up the church steps and stood in the doorway i noticed i hadnt tied my tie yet surprising i normally do that as soon as i put a dress shirt on i fumbled with my tie for a while and no matter how much i tied it i couldnt get it right im at my fathers funeral and all i am thinking is i need to be a man now and i cant even fucking tie this thing i finally had someone assist me with it and walked away into a corner and shed a few tears i felt embarrassed i gather myself and go stand near the door to greet the people that are coming in i see some prominent people from our town and soon the door is getting crowded and people just pile keep piling in people were giving me their condolences and telling me how i looked like my father like my father i am starting to think about my speech and how i am going to condemn these people and they are telling me how great my father is and how he would be proud at the man i am becoming fuck everybody is now in the church and we are escorted to the front of it i glance back and see people standing the church wasnt big enough if only my dad could see this the funeral proceeds and it comes time for me to talk i walk up and look out onto the crowd i pull my speech out of my pocket and slide my glasses up my nose like my father often did do i look like my dad yet they all laughed and in that moment i realized this is a celebration of a life not a roast to these people i have a few words to say but i wont be reading the speech it is going to be between me and my father i babble on for about five minutes and then i look at my mother i see how she is sitting there and i think about the exchange we had the other night at the viewing and without thinking i said i know what the records say but my father died at home with his sons and he died of a broken heart _person_ i walked off the stage and sat down next to my brother and he said good job man you said what needed to be said did i need to say it though i start to sob to myself as the music keeps playing and people are talking about how great my father was i wouldnt be surprised if there are multiple people here who owe their life to _person_ he was one of the best ive ever worked with and he will be missed the funeral has now ended and we need to carry the casket to the hurse there will never be an object that is heavier than a casket is physically and mentally for a human this is

adores its actually sad she and my older sister are so far up each others asses its disgusting my mother has no problem supporting them through their average mundane problems she has all the sympathy in the world for them me i get told to stop whining if i dare confide that im having a hard time with my mood i just got back from my _person_s i went to try to make amends for the verbal attack she launched on me last time i saw her i was basically told she doesnt want to see me again i came home and told my mother and confided that im obviously pretty hurt about it it turned into another attack on me i hate these people im done my niece is the only reason im alive i cant do that to her and yet im dead inside these people have broken me down bit by bit they have picked apart every single thing about me from my disorder to mocking the fact that i selfharm to telling me everything is my fault my mother has even told me before that i have no reason to be struggling with the fact that i was molested as a toddler and almost raped as a preteen because loads of people are molested seriously i cant do this much longeri have been battling mental illness for 10 years i have no family support but am stuck living with my mother and sister moving out isnt an option right now i cant even afford to eat seriously my disability money got messed up and it could be many more months before i get the medical assessment i am required to have in order to receive money my mother reminds me almost daily that i am a drain on her and that she doesnt plan to help me so im literally going to starve on top of everything else i just cant cope with this anymore i cant everyone would be so much happier without meim so irrelevant in the eyes of my family i know they wouldnt care if i died not for long anyways but im too scared of what it will do to my niece were extremely close and i know i cant do it to her shes 5 it would mess her up for life but i have nothing left in me im dead inside i cant even afford to eat and my family dont really care im so angry im repulsed im already dead insidemy mothers latest plan of getting me out of her life and the house is by insisting that im going to this womens college in september where you live mondayfriday im not and no this is not because she cares she literally just wants me gone i have been waiting 6 months for my disability benefit to get sorted and have had no money since ive been helped by the wonderful people at rassistance a few times and they have enabled me to eat but i dont want to ask again i know how it must look me asking for handouts yet again so i had no option this morning but to leave a note asking my mother if i could borrow some money to get groceries since i have to feed myself she left me a note with about 10 conditions on it including that i have to go and look at the college i am going to in september id rather starve i have mental health issues that are mostly caused by her borderline personality disorder anxiety disorder and chronic depression oh and im slipping further and further into dissociation im now blacking out and losing chunks of time i want to die so much but i have this beautiful almost 6yearold niece whom i am very very close with i know that killing myself would mess her up i cant do it to her but i cant go on either i barely leave the house due to anxiety weeks go by in which i dont leave the house or see anyone my family treat me like a piece of shit im being blackmailed just to be able to eat my entire day revolves around trying not to slip into dysphoria nobody will help me because i have a prescription painkiller addiction my psychiatrist literally discharged me from the nhs service because of it he wont let me have therapy until i quit the painkillers but i cant quit the painkillers until i have a reason to not need them right now they are the only thing that makes the pain stop and thats only the case for maybe a half hour i just cant do this anymore im worthless and there is nothing i can offer to this world i think my niece would be better off without me but i cant get around the fact that it would screw her up she is my world and i dont want to do that to her but i dont want to do this either i feel like im being suffocated and punched in the face over and over my anger is out of control and i worry that as my mental health declines im going to do something to my mother i hate her so much no there is nothing good that can come out of going to this college its not even real college its pointless i just want to slit my own throatwhat do you do when your own mother is your tormenter im dead inside she has destroyed every part of me i have lost everything i ever loved to her words and constant degradation i have no way of moving out i couldnt even cope with moving out but i cant cope with staying either shes made it clear that she would be happier if i wasnt here my rage is getting out of control i sit here cutting my arms because if i dont ill kill her i fear that eventually i will anyway i have borderline personality disorder anxiety disorder and chronic depression possibly also bipolar disorder my mothers understanding of bpd which she told me tonight youre manipulative you think everyone is against you you think youre five years old you do things when it suits you she refuses to actually research bpd or engage in treatment apparently she doesnt have to care since im an adult but if my sisters so much as frown she is there in a heartbeat i had to beg for her to lend me some money for groceries and this is what it turned into she wont lend me the money i have nothing i am worthless and pointless and cant even afford to feed myself i want to die so so badly but my niece is my world were so close and it would destroy her if i killed myself i cant do that to her but i cant stay either it hurts to breathe,-1165.81,484.9,499.05,0.0,7.57,65.0

285,30316,i hear voices and since i stopped my meds last friday theyre getting worse and worse and they want me to kill myself i think to go and help them in their dimension im really lonely its lonely hearing voices im scared i dont want to do this anymore im diagnosed with schizophrenia i dont really know if the doctor was telling me the truth but the people i trust tell me they agree i have an unsupportive mother but sometimes she can be supportive not often my sister is good people would be hurt and said if i died and i really wanna stick around and watch my nephew who i love with all my heart grow up but the voices wont quit and i dont know how much longer i will last like this i want to help them as they keep telling me to do but i have to kill myself to do it its like a greater calling like im destined to do more than live in this dimension i have to die and travel and help people because im the only one that can hear them but at the same time i love my friends even when they cant make time for me and i love my family even if they can be extremely screwed up i just dont know what to do i see my therapist tomorrow and i will talk to him but i know he is already extremely concerned about me since i stopped taking my medication and im afraid hell hospitalize me which will go over very badly with both my mother and sister i dont know if i can handle thata few weeks ago i was diagnosed with schizophrenia after having symptoms since the end of last year i dont know what to believe anymore some days its easier to believe that im just sick and all the beliefs i get about the world and other people and the voices i hear are just part of it but most days i get sucked in i cant stop thinking about these other worldsdimensions and people watching me judging me that people in another dimension need my help and i have to kill myself to get to them because thats what they keep telling me to do i had to stop working because i was hospitalized for getting really suicidal and psychotic the hospital is where i got diagnosed im off meds currently because i couldnt stand the side effects of them so i just stopped about two and a half weeks ago or so i just started working again only 3 days a week at a web design company i dont know what i want to do with the rest of my life i feel broken i was so sure i was going to get into making websites and stuff and i feel like i want to know more i know html and just looking at code makes me feel good because i love that i can understand it when i remember so clearly a time when i thought it was the most difficult thing ever and it all looked like an alien language so i guess im proud of myself for learning it even though it wasnt that hard and its not a big thing i just like that i can make sense of something that i couldnt before so thats one good thing i used to draw a lot now i dont i just kinda fell out of it from being sick i feel stuck i was sexually abused as a kid and that factors into some of my delusions well its one of my beliefs that i dont really talk about because the one person i told assured me it wasnt real but it haunts me it hurts so much im alone and im worthless and i feel like im never going to be as special as i felt when i was a kid getting a bunch of attention from this pedophile i though was my friend i feel like ive lost myself this year i dont know what to do anymore i dont know what kind of future i see when sometimes its so hard to focus and think and i feel so stupid the best thing in my life is my nephew hes the 1 reason i dont kill myself because if i cant be sure of anything and i dont know if this is reality anymore and everything is fucked i know hes real because ive watched him grow up and hes almost a kid and its amazing seeing him learn and change and im scared to go and lose seeing more of that but at the same time im through with being hurt and sad and my brain not working im through with questioning every gorram thing and every person that looks at me its exhausting its so lonely to hear voices telling me that they need my help and i have to kill myself and nobody seems to care or understand it anyone have any idea what im supposed to do next its either kill myself or find something meaningful to do for myself and im lost about it it doesnt seem like theres anything i can do to escape this schizophrenia is sort of a

nephew away from me moving to a new state for financial reasons he is my absolute world ive watched him grow and think and create adorable stories that could make anyone laugh ive watched him become more and more human each day and ive had him call me his best friend and call me lego face on halloween when i dressed up as pixels and he means the verse to me the whole gorram verse he keeps me still when i want to grab a blade or a bottle of pills and do very stupid things to myself he keeps me thinking about the benefits of tomorrow instead of the painbut some days im so broken he cant fix me me his aunt i have schizophrenia and some days im all too aware of it and some days im gone some days i cant be bothered to use logic and admit to reality some days i spend in my head talking to other dimensional victims of an interdimentional god that i hear in my head that i know quite personally at this point ive thought about it enoughhe wont remember me hes only 3 he wont remember i wont be too important in his life if i go now i dont want to leave him i want to watch him grow up into a successful little human and earn all his happiness i want to watch him be the good person i know he will be because his heart is so sweet but i dont get that nope i dont deserve that i have other goals other missions fraking delusions i dont know that they aremy name is cristine im 22 years old and im can communicate with other dimensions i can hear them and sometimes see them and theyre begging me for help theyre calling me their savior your god he seeks you the demon is a god and he is waiting for me on the other side waiting to fight for the people hes abusing im all too aware im schizophrenic but this isnt apart of it this is real this has to be real i have to kill myself to save them i have to kill myself to go their dimension and kill their demon their god hes looking for me i miss my nephew already he means so much to me but i have to abandon him for the countless lives i have to save in the other dimension this isnt easy for me this is very horribly painfuli only hope he doesnt remember me im losing whatever the universe is doing to me im losing whats keeping me going now is sitting at home watching scifi shows and reading comics trying to keep calm about my own death im gonna do it in one month im giving myself that much time to get things in order to have someone convince me the people i hear and the people i feel suffering are just my brain miscommunications oh frak i want to cut i want to bleed they told me to anyways sacrifice your blood im so far so lost in the woods someone show me a clear path did any of that even make sense i feel so messed up right now it could just look like nonsense please help me im only asking here on reddit because i trust reddits help ive gotten good help from here in the past good peoplehelpim 22 im a schizophrenic i firmly believe in other dimensions i believe that i can communicate with one i can hear and rarely see people and creatures from the other dimension the voices i hear tell me that i have to kill myself in order to travel to the other dimension and kill a mad god that is hurting everyone there the mad god is also a man from this dimension that abused me as a child and died here and was transported there i dont know why but thats what it is im on meds im well aware that my story above sounds pretty fraked up and crazy im aware it sounds delusional and im aware that im schizophrenic but fraking frak the delusional thinking is so seductive it grabs hold of me and i cant get it out of my head i keep thinking that i have to go off my meds i have to hear voices again im their savior i have to save them to save them means to end my life and now im seriously considering it just like ive done before except before i determined that it was all a bad idea that i was simply sick that the world didnt have that much planned for me i wasnt really that important not the savior of a whole dimension of people suffering and the hands of a pedophileand now maybe i am maybe its sick to say its just schizophrenia its just this disease i have leading me the wrong way in the verse or maybe im really that important and i need to end my life to save billions i can get close to him im already close to him i dont know what to do i want to go off meds hear voices clearer listen to what they say and kill myself thats my plan i dont know what to doim schizophrenic i miss the voices im all alone now i have to save them have to kill myself i think im going to do it i should be getting my refill of ativan today or tomorrow and with the pills i still have left i think i can leave this dimension and go to the next to save my peopleim done im absolutely done no one believes me no one in real life really gets the struggle i cant my therapist says i have constant conflicts with reality due to my schizophreniai cant do this anymore i have to save a world in another dimension from a demon thats as simply as i can put it thats the gorram truth and no one sees it they have to open their eyeswhen my meds get here im off gonna take a ton of ativani get the 2mg pills instead of 1 with a ton of alcohol and let myself go into the other dimension its my responsibilityi need help voices im schizophrenic voices youre crazy kill yourself your brain is broken youre a burden wake up youre in hell

286,30432,i suffer from severe depression as most likely a lot of people here do im not here for help or to whine just to rant a bit and maybe talk to some fellow crazies ive had depression and anxiety issues since i was young my first attempted suicide i was only seven years old i watched my dad abuse our dogs abuse me and abuse alcohol on a regular basis my mom kept herself locked in her room leaving me and my sisters alone every day ever since ive been at war with my own mind as i grew older everything got worse and worse i started using drugs became a sex addict and pushed away everyone who tried helping the only person i trusted was christina this girl was my world we dated all throughout highschool and a while after when she got pregnant i joined the army as a way to support them even though i had what seemed to be a great life i couldnt shake the suicidal thoughts things went south one night she had to talk me off a roof and it was more than she could handle she left me and took my son i was devastated for months i wouldnt talk to anybody or leave the house eventually i went broke and became homeless jumping around from place to place the drug use got worse after a few years i fell back in love i was depressed but so was she we would lock ourselves in a basement smoking pot and sniffing dope over time we both cleaned up ive been working part time and trying to keep myself clean recently she left me as well letting me know explicitly that she only wants drugs and sex from random guys i was crushed now im at an old friends wasting away day after day i battle suicidal thoughts constantly never trusting myself around ropes or sharp objects ive tried to control myself but i find myself lashing out slicing my chest and scalp stabbing my legs and forearms i do not wish to do this something simply takes hold of me and forces my hand at those moments i dont care if i live or die and that scares me the amount of blood ive seen pour out of me before passing out has made me certain would never wake yet here we are today im not a violent person towards anyone but myself even blaming myself for other people wronging me i can never trust myself as im constantly plagued by these dark thoughts i know one day my life will end by way of my own hand and ive accepted that now i just battle myself every day seeing how long i can last im simply waiting for that one day it will all endtldr im my own worst enemy and every day is a fight,-395.43,188.9,195.07,0.0,7.75,56.0
287,30566,this life has many ideas that can help the worldbut whats the point of life if the world including me cant help myselfall i want is love but after a time i realized my family isnt a lovely one it was just a family with all members loving each other but our mean was hatred to nonchristian society a desire to get away from humans that dare act natural in specific waysi know how to be alone quite well im quite good at it of course there is my brother who provides much comfort and plenty of lighthearted jokes that are fun to be a part of but everyone in my family i can feel them all expecting me to change back to who i was when i was youngeri smoke pot and dropped out because i felt like school was a waste of time to you im your typical drop out nut job i am a nut job because i know what people mean when they say that they mean i do the things that they would be uncomfortable doing themself i say great good for you want a fucking trophy i love this planet so much and life an biology all can get me so excited not to mention the other sciences which are so captivating to the brain i was born with i am so passionate about our universe i am even quite grippy on my own life but the thing is i just dont see the horizon anymore i think becoming someone acceptable to society is an extremely stupid cause one of ignorance and desire something that bothers me is that people do not see that as a sensible perspective of our society i dont blame people for ignoring great facts and conforming to whatever gets them at least the minimal amount of dopamine their brain wants to blame people is pointless i hate blaming my father always loved to analyze who is to blame for every fault eventually i saw it differently that the mistakes are what makes us literally i look around and i dont see a perfect society and thats fine everyone does that and they think about it every long afternoon and get on with their busy lives me i had a lot more time to think the truth is if society was set up differently we would each and all have found our best friends how well first it would require a society that cares about the human biology and the first inventions nature our society here in america at least is concerned with profits the feeling i get about americas history is that the intention of this design was so that people can have a life to their own versus how it was in england where everything for a single person was not immune from the monarchys every desiremy life is sad because i am sad i am less sad when i remember suicide i have no close friend for many miles but i have no one that is like me no one that got as excited as purely for simply being alive besides if i go to pass it will be a small loss for you all i promise if you dont believe me well_url_ yeah i know that value is an imagined thing and i can assign value to my life and i in fact value my life extremely this is not a matter of logic it is a matter of feeling you know how you felt like marrying that one person and so you did thats the same with people who commit suicide they feel like dying over and over again and every time it interacts with their logic thus compounds more and more as a real possibility i have reached a point ive reached many times where it seems like a good idea to commit suicide the reason i may want to really do it is because i always reach a state where i feel alienated from the people i hold tender one thing i noticed is i have become narcissistic and by a very traditional sense i barely post on social media websites i actually just enjoy my own company and i used to think when i was young and children would call me weird and now today my brother who visits from out of state he calls me weird i dont mind being called weird except for when it is said in these instances the weird that people say just so they can get away from absorbing you their mind says delete that act because its useless to me being weird is life doing things for the sake of doing them instead of for a purpose is what i want to do with my life truly its what everyone wants to do i know i can escape my suicidal thoughts but is it worth itlet me add i know how getting into a routine of any sort will help me to distract myself from suicide i do not want a distraction i want to fix my problems at the root and to me what fixing my problems at the root means learning how to survive in nature and leaving for any edge into a forest for good i would actually love to do that but i would far much prefer to live anywhere where there are people willing to meet disagreement with acceptance i want to meet inquisitive people they are quite rare arent they many people think they are great thinkers but really they are just good at talkingif you want to send me videos articles book titles whatever that would be fine thank you for reading this internet buddyjust read my post before posting and heres a the main reason humans crave ludicrously to be part of a community thankfully we are all born into a community however at some point in our life we realize we have different core beliefs than the community does so we feel so alienated that we would hope for a while and eventually like a sun setting we lose hope we didnt run fast enough whatever the cause and we just realize that when we are so alone in our core beliefs that the only one that will truly feel the pain of your loss is no one the feeling of alienation is only bad when people do it with a heart of hatred to alienate someone with love is to naturally alienate them and then fight the alienating response your having and to be kind to them i havent felt love in a long time just dopamine from people telling me that they do,-1038.94,436.2,449.39,0.0,7.86,58.0

300,32063,ive had depression issues for so long and i am horrible at asking for help im afraid to talk to people about it for one i have time coming to terms with the fact that someone would care and im also afraid of speaking true feelings that would ultimately cause others to seek professional help for me essentially making it publici was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a couple of months ago they got me started on mood stabilizers which definitely have a positive effect but dont fix the issue i feel so out of place around my friends theyre just so confident and and genuine that i just feel like they like me out of obligation i cant even fathom what i might bring to the table for them i have no confidence or self esteem i let people walk over me and i accept every negative aspect of my life as something i deserve i hate my physical appearance and no one ever seems to react positively to me i have no interest in things i once enjoyed im growing so apart from my family and it tears at my heartstrings but i know ill never let them know how much i love them and appreciate their lovei hate how miserable i am all the time and the feelings only get worse no matter how many doctors i talk to nothing helps i have such a mountain of financial debt and i just dont know how anyone could actually expect me to be ok with willingly going on it doesnt seem fair that im pressured to stay alive i dont want to the thought of how much life i have left ahead of me only makes me feel more hopeless i dont look forward to living out the rest of my life it causes this fear that is so real and ive never experienced anything like it before im ashamed and embarrassed that i harm myself frequently but no one will ever know it i initially thought i would want someone to confide to but now im thinking that i wouldnt even want that the thought of someone actually loving me and truly caring about my well being seems absurdi dont want to kill myself and i dont plan on it anytime soon but i know im not happy being alive anymore,-310.51,154.2,160.15,0.0,8.21,61.0

302,32144,i have been told to come here because of my last post_url_ on 2x i am a 17 year old in high school i have a fairly average lifestyle my parents dont fight much or abuse me i have had a boyfriend for six months i live in a nice house and i can afford some of the things i want but dont necessarily need and i have great friends however i feel completely dead to the world i feel like that i have no connections with people especially my friends and parents my boyfriend is the closest one i have but even to him i feel disconnected sometimes i feel that i have no meaning to be in this world everyone else seems to have their priorities straight but i cant seem to find a meaning for me to be here also i feel that i can never do anything right i have noticed that this could stem from my family at home when i do chores and such i get yelled at because its not good enough mom has ocd i have told my parents 3 times in the past 4 months that i think im depressed and that i have been contemplating suicide but they never do anything about it i have talked to friends and a couple of adults and they told me to keep telling my parents i dont know where to turn or what to doedit thanks for the support guys i wrote this at 6 in the morning so i missed a few minor details for instance depression runs in my family both my grandmother and older brother have been diagnosed with severe cases why my parents dont believelisten to me hell if i know also i was going to mention that i have given up on religion live in the bible belt parents are strict christians and for a while i thought that was the source of my emptiness but its not also i saw a movie_url_ that was about a kid who turned himself in for depressionsuicidal thoughts after watching the movie with my brother i told him that it was exactly how i felt great movie by the way it seems though that some people are just saying to think positively its really really difficult for me and i dont know why ive tried in the past though i had a friend who wanted to help and did her own research and tried to give me advice one was to write down three good things that happened today and the other was to try to revert bad thoughts into good by coming up with silly mental images related to the negative thought the silly mental image was supposed to be silly enough to make me laugh on the inside and cause a small bit of dopamine to be released causing the bad thought to be silly and meaningless while the good thought remained to be the more important one these two things worked effectively but only for just a couple of days and then it wore off i dont know what else to do,-435.01,204.1,211.13,0.0,7.52,56.0

murder fantasy i broke into a friends moms house and stole her shoes and jewelry today i wanted to snatch someones purse for money so i could get drugs to take me away from this world i will probably still do it and some how i dont feel bad doing any of it ive stolen from friends and family im a kleptomaniac and i enjoy it why does anyone give a shit about me if they even really do why im a petty con man and thief i wasnt raised in poverty my family has wealth yet ive the gall to squander my oppurtunities and shit on my future i dont deserve to even be miserable and yet i am every hour just compounding pain ive been in pysch wards twice now the first one during a horribly abusive friendship i stayed 4 days 4 days of torture no privacy constant screaming from the other in patients they put me on risperdal i think that shit permanently fucked my brain ruined my fucking mine for what for a company to make a buck is that all i am a fucking geaunie pig a fucking failed experiment well i certainly failed ive dropped out of college 4 fucking times i have so many failed classes the only jobs ive ever had was shitty fast food or cleaning i used to work at _person_ when i had weed things could be okay when i didnt every moment spent alone led to mental breakdown i would regularly cry during delivery runs or in the freezer when i worked inside i quite without notice twice ive quit all my jobs without notice what did it matter anyways they were shit jobs for minimum wagei fucking hate being alive i cant be happy anymore the only time im ever happy is if i can get high with weed look down me for it call me a drug addict call me a junkie this world will but i dont know a single fucking soul that doesnt down something to make it through the day if i could just live in the woods and grow pot and food and smoke all day i fucking would but i cant because if i did then some fuckers would come up burn it to the ground then point guns at me and shove me into a cage until i rotted and died and society would be okay with it many would even applaud it a joke do what whatever makes you happy is a fucking joke anyone who says it is a goddamn stand up comedian okay sure fine want to know what would make me happy well i already told you id live in nature in the forest and id grow a field of pot and harvest it but i cant so i cant be happy now go ahead and tell me im wrong tell me that wouldnt make me happy and im just ever so obviously confused no no youre right and im wrong because you said so if you wanna be happy just get on your knees and beg the demon in the sky to grant you entrance to hia kingdom then slave away at a shit job you dont like to earn money for people you dont like to provide service you hate to customers you hate do it shit eater go get your shit eating job and put on your shit eating grin so you can make it another day to be promoted to shit eater leaderi live in a world where our elected leaders control a large group of violent people that will kill anyone on commandi live in a world where psychotropic pills are shoved down the throats of the mentally ill and weak to sedate them and generate profit with little to no understanding of how they worki live in a world where children are slain and raped and beaten by their own parentsa world where in my home country oppposers to the gangs and police and politicians who are one in the same are killedpeople believe in demons and gods based on fairy tales in a book but okay sure im the monster obviously i really am because ive never done _person_ shit about it but complain never done

319,33604,edit goodbyeim not intending this to sound like a rant so i apologize if it comes off that way im just a long winded personi was born on tour with the grateful dead at the forum in la needless to say my parents were hippies they moved up to canada before i was a year old but my dad constantly beat my mom so they divorced when i was 4 the only time i saw him after that was at my cousins funeral when i was 17 i held my tongue out of respect for my cousin who passed awaywhen i was 12 my mom sister and i moved down to san diego california i went from a very happy community where i had good friends to a place where i knew nothing about every day was hell as i would constantly get beat on my middle school has a lot of cholo kids as did my high schools so i started taking self defense to protect my self at school karate became my life as i was spending almost every day at the _person_ eventually becoming the sempai highest _person_ of the classafter i finished middle school i was on the bottom of the totem pole but that quickly changed as my classmates learned i could now fight backthen one day as i was walking home i dropped by my old middle school to say hi to my friends that were in the grade below me where one of the bullies that had once picked on me was still attending as he had been held back a year he unaware to my new ability to fight attacked me barehanded while he managed to break my glasses he only succeeded in enraging me i lost my temper and started beating him as hard as i could in the chaos he pulled out a knife which i had been taught to defend myself against i reversed the blade on him planting it into his own stomach this secured my arrest and expulsion from the san diego school districti was promptly sent to _person_ which is where i spent 6 months of not knowing what became of the boy i fought and stabbed eventually not caring the only time i cried is when i found out my dog cisco had been put to sleep while i was locked up it was really after this that i started to notice an absence of emotionsafter spending christmas and my 15th birthday in juvy i was released into house arrest for another 6 months the only communication i was allowed was online which was how i stayed in contact with my friends in canada as i didnt have good enough friends to talk to me after that incident in san diego however i was allowed 1 on 1 time at the _person_ with my sensei i was spending around 12 hours a day trainingby the time i was off house arrest i had caught up to my schooling through jccs being expelled from my high school left me with little option of where to attend so i entered the charter school program which allowed me to continue spending most of my time training as i was finishing semesters in a matter of days and only turning in the work once every 2 weeks this lasted for around a yearwhen i was 16 i wanted to start attending a normal school again and try to still manage some sort of a normal adolescence i had gotten back into my high school that i was originally attending unfortunately 2 months after the school year began my mom had a disagreement with the principal which lead to me immediate expulsion then after a long bout of trial and error with different schools in the area all of which i was expelled for fighting in self defense i was allowed into la jolla high school which is a very respected high school on the only condition that if i was not allowed to fight in the situation of a fight i was to just get hit and leave it at that and that was fine by me for the chance to graduate normally actually walk and get my high school diplomasince la jolla high was operating on a classic schedule and my old school was on a 4 block schedule i was staying after school for an 8th period where i was in the office answering phones for an extracurricular at 330pm i got out went to a vending machine just for a snack as i was very hungry not even 2 minutes after i sat down for my gummi worms yet another bully came up to me for the sole purpose of torment he took my food and when i asked for it back he punched me in the stomach it barely hurt so i knew taking a beating was entirely possible i made it through the ordeal with my favorite rufio shirt torn into an unwearable state a bloody lip and some bruises on my abdomen nothing bad at all and that didnt even slow them down whatsoever in my expulsion regardless of the dont throw a punch promise that i held up to they still kicked me outin the very same week my sensei whom i thought to be dying shes 70 from the manner in which she was teaching me told me she was moving to a different state she told me this while i was a low brown belt and for the next year i trained every day so when she moved to train with the head of my style hanshi aka teacher of teachers i followed her and skipped my middle brown belt and high brown belt to achieve _person_ or first black belt i am very proud of this but there isnt much a black belt from a traditional style can do with out their sensei so with no where to go from there i joined the militaryi origionally wanted to become an eod but due to a training accident in bootcamp that quickly became more fantasy what i thought was a sprain turned out to be a rare untreated form of _person_ which ruined blood flow to my talus navicular causing it to collapse i thought it was just a sprain so i kept it to myself not wanting to stay in boot camp any longer than i had to so i switched rates to fire control the guys that shoot the cannons on a shipthis rate turned out to have a 2 year contract extension which i signed in a stack of papers i was told to signand that 2 years was spent at great lakes _person_ _person_ this base had one of the highest suicide rates out of any base in the military i believe there were 36 in the 2 years i spent there accounting for roughly 10 of all suicides in the navy per year needless to say i was unhappyi was constantly in trouble for the sole reason of my depression to the point where i would sleep in a comatose state and they would be unable to wake me with the assistance of a bullhornwhen the truth of my injury came to light the base doctors put it down as a prior injury due to the wear on the bones from my martial arts training when taken i was taken to an orthopedic surgeon he said my foot would be able to be fixed with surgery and my tricare would cover it when it came time for my insurace company to say they would foot the bill they stepped up to the plate and said they would pay in full all i needed was approval for the convalescent leave which the base denied on the ground that they were removing me from service which i had heard no news of until it came time to fix my foot they kicked me out with half months pay x4 which had to come out of my tspand now ive been out for a year in which i helped my family open a medicinal marijuana dispensary that i may or may not work at i say that because every day i live in fear of getting fired lately its been so bad that i may not even be able to make rent this month as every day i show up for work i get yelled at for something irrelevent to work the reason im currently fired is because i lost a contact lens the time before that was because i didnt eat breakfastim running out of ability to tolerate the world if anyone can bring the slightest ammount of happiness to me it would be much appreciated but as it stands im ready to kill myself,-1403.32,576.2,592.96,0.0,7.46,54.0

324,33936,not intentionally and its probably not even a cry i tend to be extremely silent in the case of my emotions itd be nice to have someone to talk to about them but it has been beaten into me since i was young that i dont have significant problems that they are my own and i should not bother people with them because they do not matter essentially i wish that i could break this mentality but its extremely difficult and i hate putting stress on others i hate being a burden and i would rather help everyone else be happy than to work on myself being happy needless to say things are ratherrough put very loosely my friends what little ones i do have hardly notice when anything is wrong then when they do i feel guilty that they did i feel like i wasted their time when they come to me because i know im going to lie to them and tell them im fine and that i dont need any help im going to go home that night and cry because im so fed up with everything which usually leads to the ritual of selfhate and inevitably picking up the blade i wish i could stop i really do i hate this almost as much as i hate myself for everything i do i started therapy and its nerve wracking between the anxiety and the still very real overbearing feeling of guilt and mistrust i dont know how well this is going to help i made a new friend and already i feel like im doing is annoying and boring him i really do want friends i just dont know how to make them properly i dont know i dont know where to start and things are just terriblethings are a little hectic in my life right now im seeing a therapist who is doing probono work for me and its helping but only to a certain degree i keep a lot from my friends and family and its gotten to the point where the only things that help are some of the worse worse yet one of my closest friends has inexplicably ceased contact with me its only made things that much more difficult to handle because ive tried what ive been thinking is my best to stay friends we had a really great weekend and then nothing no explanation either it just solidifies the thought in my head that people dont actually care about anyone beyond themselves and that most people are lying through their teeth when they say they care i dont understand how i can get this feeling to stop i dont even feel like i exist i sit in my room every single night and cry and i dont really know the reason why anymore the feeling of helplessness is so overwhelming and i only feel even more worthless when i reach out like this theres a little piece of me that breaks even more when i cant be everyones rock anymore i need someone anyone really my best friend didnt care my family doesnt i dont even give a shit anymore i just need a shoulder to cry on,-449.22,209.6,216.91,0.0,7.92,59.0

328,34169,hey reddit im a female canadian who is about a month away from turning 20 i currently have not finished high school and am failing miserably at getting my last 2 credits i cant even step into a class room because of the fear of people judging me i suffer from anxiety disorders and depression the only person who knows about the problems im having at school is my boyfriend weve been dating for a year well last night we kind of had a bit of an argument i say kind of because it was more him getting annoyed and telling me im not trying enough and me just agreeing with him to make it go away im probably not trying enough and i could probably do better i should have my high school its not that hard of a goal i mean i should be in some form of post secondary school by now even though i have no way in hell to afford itlast night it got to the point where i was counting out how many pills i have and whether or not it would likely kill me to take all of them it likely wouldnt but considering my grandfather doesnt notice if i leave the house or not i wouldnt get medical help until thursday because thats when my mom visitsi think the main reasons i havent done anything is because of my mom my boyfriend and my oldest niece who considers me her best friend i think she could have it explained to her if i did go through with suicide shes gifted but i dont want her to have to understand this concepti dont want to leave herbut im screwing up my life i dont want to keep going this way ive tried going to a hospital before for suicidal thoughts but i was told that im not the type and i should sleep off the feelings i dont know what to do anymore i want to give up so badly but i dont how to make it any easier for them i mean moms busy worrying abiut grandpas health and i dont want to burden her i could get into a fight with my boyfriend and breakup with himthat could make it easier on him but that still leaves two peoplei dont know how to get help or what to do anymoreim still thinking about it but i still have a few things left to do im buying my boyfriends birthday present next weekend and the weekend after im babysitting that niece i mentioned earlier after thati dont know what there is to cling onto ive been using family events for the past month just to get through each weeksorry i just need to get this off my chest sorry for posting just need to unload on a place where nobody knows mei know i sound crazy but hear me out im a trans guy who will be 22 this may im depressed have a shit ton of anxiety and just recently got diagnosed with body dysphoria i was born as a baby girl and yet i cant identify with it i recently got put on testosterone and hormone blockers to stop my body from producing estrogenhowever it hasnt made any big changes which i understand that stuff takes time but until then im stuck looking like this lie that i tell everyone around me to random people who pass me by they see a girl to my gay best friend im a girl im not mad that he doesnt like mejust wish my biology didnt work against me to my grandfather who i live with thanks to everyone in my family urging me not to tell him im a girl to my mother who still doesnt want to see her beautiful thin blond daughter who was everything she never was her words not mine im still a girl and i hate it typing this makes me feel sick to my stomach and angryicant do this anymore i look at myself and see a person who i cant continue to care about or identify with i hate it more than ive hated anything else i was always told that the worst thing i could do is lie but living like this is just another lie that i cant wait to unbubble i cant keep dealing with people seeing this false image of myself cant stand to see this image of myself cant stand to look myself in the eyes im writing my goodbyes tonight i justi cant say goodbye in personive had a lot of time to think about this i got sick with the flu this week and was bedridden and by myself a lot i used to date someone who feels like my opposite back then she was just coming to terms with being trans and i supported her ill admit it i was jealous i was jealous when i saw her smile when i did her makeup and hair when she looked better in my clothes than i did i felt envy that comfort she was able to see she was able to see herself as a womani want that hard as i try to find anything that makes me look boyish feminine attributes keep showing up i cant hide my chest even with binding and my mother is utterly against me getting a haircut that is too short why the hell cant i just do it regardless i dont know why its easier for me to come to terms with dying than getting her disapprovalnot to mention that in a couple of months i lose my medical plan so all of my meds are no longer going to be covered theres no way ill be able to afford everything the antidepressants the anti anxiety meds the asthma meds and then the hormone stuffespecially with no job i wont be able to afford it and if i went on disability id just disappoint my mother again shes very vocal about how she wants me to get a steady job and go to post secondary shes terrified ill get disability according to her im not that bad off the depression and anxiety isnt that bad i should be able to keep a jobit shouldnt be an issuewell at least this way she can still have me buried with my legal female name might even be buried in a dress since i dont have a suit guess shell still have that girl image she clings to at least shell be happy with the way she remembers me_person_ trans guy who cant be patient with the time it takes to transition cant stand the way his body looks and screams female and would rather die than continue lying by living,-1057.21,443.2,456.35,0.0,7.4,57.0
329,34271,dear reddit four years ago my boyfriend committed suicide and i hated him for it at first i was so angry with him that i didnt realise how depressed i really was and eventually how suicidal i had also become i luckily had a very close friend who pulled me through this and eventually we became a couple this weekend i found out that he has been cheating on me for almost a year and a half depression is something that i have been struggling with for so long that its hard to see the point any more even when things have been good its only ever been temporary i feel like ive lost my lifeline as well as feeling so incredibly betrayed by the only person ive ever really trusted i know that a lot of people must post really similar things every day and i dont know what can even help at the moment but im really quite desperatei know that there are a lot of people who have been in a similar postion to mine and i was really hoping someone could offer me some advicehaving been depressed for a very long time with one suicide attempt already ive really hit rock bottom these last couple of weeks i have to believe that things will get better but i can barely get through each day and i really need some help as it is i hardly eat or sleep leaving the flat is incredibly difficult and any advice to get through this would be so very welcome self harm is something ive battled with for a long time but i just cant stop i can normally distract myself by doing things with my hands like cleaning or sewing but nothing seems to work right now i just dont know what to do any more i wake up every morning wishing i was deadi have spent the last week putting all my things in order i dont really know what i want from this maybe just the chance to justify myself because i cant possibly account for my actions to the people who need to hear it i know first hand how difficult it is to deal with the loss of someone whos killed themselves and so perhaps this makes this even worse the truth is i just dont want to live any more there is only so long you can keep going for the sake of others and i just cant do it any more this isnt because of anyone else i have been bouncing between doctors and various treatments and medications for years and i am so tired of trying i cant sleep or eat or even talk to people without taking an enormous amount of medication i love my friends and family very much but i cant touch them without hyperventilating i cant function properlyi know that there are people to talk to but when every single day is a struggle you run out of options there are only so many times i can ring up my friends at 3am and ask them to come round to babysit me because i cant stop cutting myself or explain that all i did today was sit in my room and cry because my mum rang me and i was too panicked to pick up the phonei am really sorry,-473.58,218.9,226.15,0.0,7.75,57.0

345,36558,im a 22 year old male i graduated college last summer and im still currently unemployed after months of job searching i dont have my drivers license i have very few friends i have an addiction to pornography i rarely leave leave my house i live in an affluent neighborhood i think ive always hated my parentsand i just finished masturbating twice today and i think i truly want to end my lifeim aware that there are many people in the world who would love to trade places with me however today seems to be my breaking point my introduction to complete insanity it all started with an argument with my mother she spent 10 minutes picking out a loaf of bread that didnt have a dark crust the store was unusually busy so there were plenty of shoppers that were trying to get by my mom as she was scrutinizing every loaf of bread on the shelf at this point i just erupted and argued that this was entirely pointless especially since my mom ends up peeling the crust away from the bread and throwing it away but as always she got mad and refused to talk to me the rest of the time at the store and during the way home when we finally arrived home she told me that she never wanted me to go shopping with her ever again because i was complete nuisance my mother and i always have arguments like this theyre always about petty things and she always stops talking to me never giving me a chance to explain or even listen to my reasoning in fact most of my life has been this cycle of arguments the nature of the arguments is completely stupid so much so that im having regrets about mentioning this because im sure people will think that im just an immature idiot but today was just the final straw ive had enough of this shit i live in one of the leading techcenters in the world a place where high school kids are building apps and making their first million at 20 years old a place that loves the whole youngentrepreneur image engineers doctors and lawyers in my high school many of the students are the sons and daughters of parents who work in the previously mentioned fields or are professors at a prestigious local university my parents are both undocumented immigrants because of their status both of them lead isolated lives which meant ive mostly led an isolated life for the most part my parents have no hobbies at least ive never seen them do any activity that remotely resembles a hobby i guess watching tv sort of counts neither of them went to college my father works a deadend job at a grocery store while my mother works as a babysitter neither of them understood the type of environment they were going to raise their kid in they didnt understand the competitive nature of the education system or the workforce my father grew up dirt poor in a family of 11 other siblings my mother grew up in better conditions but was dominated by her father her father imposed his will on the entire family even if some his decisions seemed irrational the rest of the family he was abused as a kid and subsequently he instilled a culture of fear into my mother always making her see the dangers of the outside world and emphasizing the safehaven of family my mother passed on the same fear culture to me i have never met any of my extended family members either no its just been me my mom and my dad for 22 years of my life my childhood wasnt bad it was a normal childhood you know except for the constant reminder from my mother that the world is badand i could die at any moment i was forbidden from riding a bicycle because i could die i had quite a lot of friends and was somewhat outgoing everything seemed alright until i reached high school high school was really the time where my life began going downhill i think i began to really notice how pathetic i was how isolated i was while peers discussed their trips to x and y countries i always talked about how it was nice staying home i also began to notice how ignorant i was about the education system and how to get into college my parents always told that i was intelligent but never talked to me about how to handle failure so by the time _person_s and the harder classes began to come around i felt like an utter failure i felt stupid if i was so damn intelligent why was struggling all of a sudden my parents never talked to me about working hard and their knowledge of school was archaic i believed that people were either born intelligent or they werent and i was beginning to believe that i was part of the latter i didnt know that the rest of peers could afford cram classes private tutors _person_ classes or simply that their parents were more educated and they could give them advice through the rigors of school i was completely lost i wasnt doing well academically in high school and i sure as hell wasnt doing well socially i was never a popular kid but i did have a group of friends and could talk with almost anyone i met i floated around if you will however my social skills went in complete decline when i became acquainted with pornography in high school my parents were barely home and with the stress of school pornography turned from an innocent discovery to a form of selfmedication for my problems i was watching and masturbating so frequently that i became depressed and exhausted unfortunately im talking in hindsight because at the time i had no idea that my obsessive porn and masturbation habits were causing me so much pain even through my depression i kept masturbating and watching porn thinking that it was the only source of happiness in my life i never had any romantic experiences with any females even up to today eventually my grades began to really decrease i was just miserable college wasnt any different it was a constant battle between my depression and my confidence by this point i was completely isolated myself from friends and most people i barely went outside to socialize i usually stayed in my dorm to watch porn masturbate and watch youtube videos it wasnt until i reached my senior year of college that i realized porn was a problem and i decided that i needed to cut it from my life i promised myself that after i graduated i would work on eliminating my addictionthe summer of my graduation i was pumped to go into my recovery i quickly sought treatment i had a plan ready to go i would work a part time job working a regular job at a restaurant or retail study japanese i wanted to spend a year teaching english in japan workout and just spend time improving myself before i would step out and go after a real job however my father had different plans he wanted me to get a real job right off the bat because he thought that having graduated college automatically made me entitled to getting a job i told him about my plan but he refused to listen and partially convinced me hey i did spend a lot of my on that degree i should be getting a job with better pay well it wasnt long before i began to feel frustrated as i wasnt getting calls back from any of the places i applied to months went by and no luck mixed in that time more arguments with my mom about stupid shit and then i began to start peeking at porn again and little by little i began to relapse again and again and again this leads me to today one stupid argument later and im out again wasting my seed on pixels and adding to my depressive symptoms im still unemployed and feeling absolutely helpless i feel like theres no way out of this cycle i feel especially shameful that ive recently visited my old high school to talk to kids about going to college and trying to motivate them when im struggling to deal with my own stupid problems i feel like such a hypocrite trying to help people when i cant even help myself i dont know what to do anymore ive spent more than 8 months trying to combat my addiction to porn and better my life and all i can show for it is my cumstained boxers this is the first time ive ever truly thought about suicide i dont know where to go or what to dohow do i go forward with my lifepleasei really need helpim tired of feeling helplesstldrim a loser whos currently unemployed i had a stupid argument with my mother that sent me over the edge i lost control and broke my vow of eliminating my addiction to pornography and masturbation all i have to show for today is a wastebasket filled with

363,38629,one of my earliest memories was trying to drown supposedly carefree days of childhood were plagued with crushing depression that hasnt let up even into adulthood i had thought about suicide so much that i feel desensitized to it ive tried oding on sleeping pills and hanging when i was in the er after the sleeping pills my parents told me that i should have shot myself like a mani grew up without friends barely have any now feel terribly alone all the time even in crowded places i regret my major choice and while i taught overseas despite being good at it i dont have any passion in teaching ive been back in the states for a few months trying to get better to no avail my savings from teaching are almost gone and i still have no idea what to do with my lifetransitioning to female and being published were two of my life goals but i still feel miserable and like a failure my fiance broke up with me the day after christmas even those who said theyd stick by me always cant deal with my depression ive tried therapists medicine group counseling but still feel so hopeless and empty i feel as if i were broken born too early was going blind mute never smiling as a child and i moved around so much i remember sitting by myself during recess wondering why i couldnt be normal like the other kids being transgender on top of that just made the bullying worse was even tied up and locked in a closet by daycare staff when i was 6 for playing with dollssometimes i feel like im a specter in others lives barely noticed and not making any difference in this world there are times when i should be feeling happy but i just feel like crying i feel terribly alone my family still dont accept me ive lost interest in my passions or dont have access to them like having a pet or a piano to play everything just feels so empty i have lost appetite a year ago and even dropped from just being underweight to almost severe anorexia ive heard deep depression is when it lasts 2 years but what about 31 yearsso here i am posting to strangers for help because i have no one in my life to turn to after surviving attempts i have i figured the bridge was the surefire way oddly enough having it as an option has helped me in the past but the net project is moving forward so my time is short in a way it is as if someone was bricking up my fire exit and i can no longer take the heat of the fire ive been hurting for so longpeople say im strong but im noti have been depressed and suicidal since as long as i can remember i first tried taking my life when i was seven i tried again and again almost succeeding with a hanging my parents told me to kill myself when i was a kid i dont have an accepting familybut these past few weeks have been horrible thing after horrible thing i had a recent breakup with the woman i love im a girl by the way she thinks we need time apart a year of no talking if we will ever talk again i had to give away my dog the closest thing to family that i have my friend of ten years decided to no longer be my friend for a few months to teach me patience i lost my position at a suicide hotline due to being under stress despite being really good at it it was the one thing that gave me purpose in life hearing others say i saved their life helped me to continue living despite dealing with chronic suicidality myself so now i turn to strangers for help as everyone in my life has grown weary of hearing about my depression i lost so much in rapid succession i feel terribly isolated and alonei have a plane ticket to jump off golden gate bridge tomorrow part of me doesnt want to die but this is all too much at once for one person to bear ive tried therapy antidepressents i was even hospitalized only thing that ever helped was my relationship as it was the first time i felt connected with anyone,-656.28,289.1,298.63,0.0,8.21,56.0

369,39562,id just like to get all this down somewhere and hopefully organize my thoughts along the way hello by the way in advance thanks for reading im 25 now male ill preface this by saying that ive had a lot of mental issues ever since i can remember but i wont get too much into that just for the sake of time i have depression ocd social anxiety trichotillomania i might be bipolar and i might also be a compulsive liar i dont know after i graduated from college with a _person_s degree in culinary arts nutrition i was almost immediately hired into a culinary management training program for a large successful hotel company as i lived in new york at the time at my family home i had to move out to one of their properties in california if i wanted to take the job of course i leapt at the offer fast forward a little bit ive moved out there to ca started my job and had my own apartment am paying my billscollege loans i leased a new car i made enough money that i could throw it around a little within reason but i was overall pretty comfortable i lived about 1 mile from a popular beach in a community with a good night life selection of restaurantsshops and easy access to the highway after a year of living there i get pretty tired of my job the hours are long i work 60 hours a week and sometimes work up to 10 days at a pace with no break inbetween ive worked in the culinary industry before and am no stranger to this but im just not that passionate about the field anymore and want to do something else something less stressful with less hours more of a stable lifestyle i dont have the aspirations to be a great famous chefbut the problem was that they really liked me at the company when i was there i worked hard was passionate about the food that i made and my chefs and coworkers noticed this towards the end of my time there the chefs wanted to make me a souschef pretty big deal for someone like me right out of school and here i am who doesnt want it other people would jump at the opportunity would give so much just to have any jobi lived in california and worked at the hotel for nearly 2 years before i made the decision to move back home to new york i wanted to move back home to ny to be closer to my friendsfamily i wanted to explore a new job and hopefully make a career change i wanted to live in new englandtoward the end of my time in cali i was thinking about killing myself nearly everyday and in fact one day i wrote a letter to my family and came very close to acting on it i have had serious thoughts on suicide for many years now but they wax and wane when i was in my adolescence i was put in the hospital for an otc drug overdose a botched suicide attempt well i ended up quitting and moving home last october i packed all my crap up and drove back to ny and moved back in with my parents in their apartment since then ive been looking for a job trying to figure out what the fuck i want to do with my life and just cant seem to think of anything that im really that interested in doing im at my wits end and i just dont want to try anymore i owe a lot of student loans for a degree that im not all that interested in the urge to commit suicide has been so strong i know now that i wont do anything beneficial to the rest of the world im just a leech i dont go outside anymore i just sit in my room with the shades drawn and browse the internet for jobs or bullshit amp play games generally i dont go outside for days at a time the friends that i thought i had here in ny arent really there for me ive been having issues with my fiance too but that could be a whole other post in itself shes been fucking this other guy and spending a lot of time with him were in an open relationship but so far its just been her spending time with other guys and me spending time with myselfi really really really should have stayed where i was i had it so good there and i threw it all the fuck away and for whatim not sure if i can continue writing this theres a lot of thoughts in my head screaming for attention and i cant seem to write them down in an orderly manner anymore i apologize if this didnt make sense to you but it makes me feel a little better that i can share this with someonebefore i get into things i just wanted to preemptively thank you for sharing your time with me im sorry we couldnt meet under better circumstancesits hard to know where to begin ive had a long and ugly history with suicide and self harm it first became apparent in my teens and came to a head when i landed myself in an overnight hospital stay for attempting to od on prescription pills since that particular occasion about 10 years ago i havent had another serious attempt although the suicidal thoughts have been ever present and plans have been thought through a couple weeks ago i again tried to kill myself only my best friend knows about this attempt without getting into details the method was carbon monoxide it would have been so perfect if that attempt were to have worked i was ready i drove about 8 hours from home to the place where i had thought to attempt the deed my parents thought i was going to a job interview a few states away and wouldnt be home for a few days i wrote out my notes to my loved ones i spent the entire day in reflection in a naturally beautiful and peaceful place that ive loved since i was a boy and by the end of the day when i started my preparations i was calm and at ease ready for the next step ready to finally rest suffice it to say here i am still talking to you now ive felt for a long time that i will eventually end my own life someday it could be this year the next or perhaps 1020 years down the road matters in my life have been taking a tailspin for years and its only a matter of time until i well up the courage again to make another determined action perhaps the worst part about it is that many people have a worse life than i do i take so much for granted a family that loves and supports me both mentally and economically while im unemployed im in good physical health i have a close friend who listens to me constantly talk about my retinue of problems and has never once complained i was fortunate enough to go to college and i have nice things like a computer and a smart phone so many things i have that others do not and it makes me feel so goddamn guilty for not appreciating them i know what i should do i should dust myself off and try my best to pick up the scattered pieces of my life if not for myself then for my parents whom have given so much up for my sibling and i over the years but i find myself totally inable some days i actually do try to engage in positive activities to break free from this horrible vicious cycle however it seems that they always seem to blow up in my face ive all but given up trying to find a job its been nearly two years since ive been gainfully employed my gf of about a year left the majority of my friends have all moved away or just dont have time for me anymore neither of which is their fault i have insomnia and cant sleep more than 4 hours or so at a clip yet i still stay in bed most of the day and read or netflix anything to escape from the reality of my situation you know i do wish that things would get better i want a job i want friends to go out and have fun with i want a romantic relationship that finally works i want to move away from my parents house again i just dont see it happening none of that is in the cards for me and yeah i know you can only make it happen for yourself and none of that will be handed to you on a silver platter unless you work for it but from the direction things are going in i just dont think i can muster up the strength to try anymore im so so tiredhey i just need to get my thoughts down again and im sorry if the prose is slightly scatterbrained i apologize if youre sick of hearing from me by now i couldnt blame you there are plenty of other lost souls on this subreddit who deserve the attention much morei think im going to attempt to kill myself within the next few days ill be using the same method i tried about a month ago carbon monoxide and hopefully it will be more successful this time im just not sure of where exactly im going to do it and a few other logistics i drove 8 hours through a handful of states for the last attempt and another 8 hours back home directly after the failed attempt and i just dont have another long drive in me especially if i fail againno one knows about the last attempt but for my best friend whom i had confessed to after the fact and you guys ive wrestled with many mental issues throughout more than half my life and im just so done before you ask im not seeing a therapist im not professionally diagnosed by a doctor or taking any medications to deal with my problems i exercise every couple days which is about all i do to try to better myself i know those are all paths i need to follow or face the consequences and die prematurely some compassionate redditors reading this subreddit have suggested those things and more to me in the past but i just cannot bring myself to do it i just want the pain to stop i want my horrible thoughts finally quelled i want to say my goodbyes to the world that i know and just sleep i know this inaction to try to fix my problems makes me undeserving of the life i have especially when considering how many utterly innocent people there are out there in the world who endure untold suffering due to war unchecked disease extreme poverty and famine many of these people will die young and never get even a glimpse at the life that im afforded with modern luxuries such as a secure house with electricity and plumbing medicine and an organized government its all relative though but despite all that i just cant do it anymore deep in my heart ive given up the spark of life is gonethank you for these few moments of your timehello it turns out im a serial poster here my girlfriend of about a year and i broke up last april ive been pretty fucked up since then the day after we broke up i blew off a job interview i had that day and tried to kill myself with carbon monoxide not simply a suicide gesture explained more completely in an older post here she doesnt know about it it wasnt just because of our breakup i have a lot of other things going on in my life which contribute toward the feelings since that failed attempt ive had my highs and lows although my highs were not particularly high and my lows have reached greater and greater depths as time drags on i think of suicide constantlywe hadnt texted or chatted on facebook since june 12th which is a long time for me i foolishly broke the law of no contact tonight by trying to call her up she didnt answer as usual nor did i receive any text i will probably get one tomorrow morning when shes on her way to work it will wake me up and i wont be able to fall back asleep again shell say shes sorry she couldnt pick up because she was out with friends or she had an early night things she usually says when she doesnt answer perhaps she was fucking a new boyfriend who knowsi dont know what i expected or wanted i suppose simply to hear her voice again i havent heard her voice since january when she left it was as if my arm was cut off she was a part of me the best part of me now that we arent talking anymore ive lost my best friend my lover my will to move on and to find a job and to move out of my parents house and better myself is all dried up i dont think i will linger much longertomorrow night im going to do it im going to leave in a few hours and drive into the night from my home to the same spot where i tried to kill myself last april its far but what does that matter anymore im packing whatever shit i need im going to wipe my computer clean my room and not look back i cant wimp out this time if it doesnt work this time i dont know what im going to do with myself i need to stop being a wimp and use a more deadly method this time i cant keep going on like this,-2321.9,929.1,955.01,0.0,7.57,59.0

380,40703,i tried to kill myself a few months back basically to avoid being a burden on society because i cant do anything right i was in the psych ward for a week i got out im supposed to be better now and for a while i was with the exception of an apathetic outlook on lifea few weeks ago our door got stuck shut when my cat was outside i could have gone out through the garage to get him but i was tired and not the most logical so i opened the window that was next to the door and tried to lift the screen out it wouldnt come out so i forced it out and bent the frame in the process now its unusablemy mom said she wasnt mad but told me to be more conscientious next time she was frustrated though but seemed quick to forgive me for acting rashlytoday i told her about how our cat couldnt figure out which door to use when i called him in even though he could see me sort of as a humorous anecdote i guess because our cat is really dumb but she started going on about how she was irritated that i was acting thoughtlessly and cost her a screen and that she didnt know where to get one and how i never have to accept consequences for my actions because im not a responsible adult i told her i was really tired and not thinking clearly she told me sometimes you have to think clearlyshe asked me to load the dishwasher and went upstairs well of course during this time all i had to think about was what a fuck up i am and kept imaging vivid images of my arms covered in cuts and bleeding profusely because thats just what i think about when i feel guilty she came downstairs and asked me if i had any plans today but i couldnt answer because i was trying not to cry then she figured that i was upset and asked me why after a long pause i told her that i didnt know she was still upset about the screenthen she told me about how she had taken years to learn mindfulness and it just drove her crazy that she had to see all these people go around and make stupid decisions without even thinking after ranting for a bit she said she was furious that i went back to my dads even after shed given me this opportunity to have a better life i couldnt tell if she meant the last time i lived with him or a few days ago when i didnt feel well and stayed with him because my appointment was near his house and i didnt feel like driving back would have been an hour drive but i didnt askthen she went on about how until i learned to do things for myself id be a burden either on her or society she said it takes a lot of practice to be that mindful and to realize what the right choices are but that every time i get close i just throw it all away because i want to be a victim or something she again referred to me choosing to live with my dad hes controlling and abusive she mentioned how i cant stay in school and that ill probably fail the next time i try because i havent improvedi dont know if this is her odd way of motivating me she said i should use these criticisms to realize whats going on and work hard to change but ive been in therapy since getting out of the hospital to do just that i thought i was working on changingshe said she was irritated about the window but that it wasnt about the window she asked if i could accept why she was upset i didnt answerthe whole time it just made sense to me that im a fuck up and she thought of me as a burden everyone probably does i tried to kill myself before because whenever i tried to change that whether that be by holding down a job or going to school i failed or was completely miserable so i could be miserable not being a burden or make other people miserable by being a burden which would also make me miserable or i could just kill myself now and spare everyone and myself all the miseryi dont know why im writing this other than to just get my thoughts out there or maybe theres another solution and i just havent thought of it because im just a thoughtless zombie burden im not sure all i know i that i hate my life and im no longer attached to its existence,-719.21,313.3,323.24,0.0,7.34,55.0
381,40756,i dont know where else to post this im in the biggest shithole predicament of my life up to this point and i feel as if i have no way out i was recently arrested about four months ago for two felony drug possession charges my house was raided because my roommate unbeknownst to me was selling drugs out of our house and ended up selling to an undercover one day i answered to a knock on the door to a gun in my face and all of a sudden dozens of cops started running into my house they had a warrant to search the entire premises during that time i had antianxiety medicine not prescribed to me in my possession as well as weed safely kept in my bedroom the police searched my room found the drugs and arrested mei was in school to become a teacher i was student teaching during the time of the arrest my students were everything to me the particular group of eighth graders i was student teaching at the time confirmed my decision to be a teacher i was making straight as finally feeling happy and fulfilled with my life and knowing this is what i wanted to do i would occasionally take a half of one of the antianxiety meds before teaching to lower my heartbeat and feelings of nervousness hence the reason i had them i tried going to therapy but the doctors i saw never helped me and i just couldnt talk to them i have a hard time talking to anyone i would come home do my homework and smoke a few bowls once i was finished with all of my work to relax and as a reward at the end of the day i enjoyed it and i didnt see anything wrong with it i never partied or brought the drugs out of my house i am a very introverted person and almost always kept to myself teaching was one of the ways i always felt would help me get over my extreme social anxiety issues in the few months following the arrest i was not able to return to student teaching which means all of my former students were basically under the impression that i ditched them i had to change my major and move out of my house i lost the few friends i did have due to my depressive introverted personality i currently live with my boyfriend who is incredibly supportive my parents are disappointed in me all i ever wanted to do was make them proud help people and just be happy with my life i feel as if i have lost almost everything that meant anything to mei finally am facing the fact that i might actually do time in jail i have a good lawyer but after doing extensive research through my lawyer and the internet i found out this particular district attorney and judges almost always sentence people with felony drug possession charges in my area to jail time i would honestly rather die than have to spend any time in jailall i wanted to do in this world was live a life helping people and trying to be happy the fact that i might have to go to jail postpone my life for years to come and become a convicted felon is driving me back into a downward spiral i am not a bad person i have never stolen anything in my life and i have never hurt a fly i dont understand what i did to deserve this i have considered suicide in the past but never as much as i have now i feel as if society and the world in general doesnt want me here i have already planned my suicide entirely as well as when i will do this i dont really know if anybody will even read this i just need somebody anybody to hear me give me your opinions if you choose i am willing to accept anything anyone wants to say thank you for listening reddittldr wanted to be a teacher got arrested realized i cant do that became unhappy now i just want to die,-616.7,273.9,283.08,0.0,7.92,55.0

would still eventually end up being distant as would anyonei went into this semester knowing i need to put on a personality of being confident and happy all the time im failing at that and it looks like the one friend i might have been making is being driven away by itedit2ive calmed down but everything in the post is still truejust want to end it all i feel alone ill never accomplish the things

claimed it was i cut an i am tryna stop so far is kinda ok ive tried slitting my wrists cause i like the blood but either i didnt have the will or by some miracle the kitchen scissors to cut meat would not slit my wrists i dont know if i could ever go all the way throught but it would be fun to see how far i go i am fked up in so many ways to long to explain if ppl are interested in hearing my story mayb i ll share it i may also be bipolar but my parents think i want attention they have seen my scars from cutting and just tell me to stop and promise that i will stop i have relapsed since i was 12 56 times i dont know wat the fk is going on but i an getting tired i tell my parents that im tired and just wanna sleep forever the dont get itmy name is cassie im 15 ive been cutting since i was 12 im naturally a protective caring and sensitive person ever since i was young i was always called ugly and fat after hearing it so many times u start to believe it even on days when i feel like i look good i refuse to believe it cause of how many times i heard im ugly my mom is _person_ and shes been through so much shit her dad was abusive but then again we are hispanic and our discipline is tough but even then thats no excuse for wat hes done to her when i was younger i used to adore and love my aunts and unclesnowshould my mom ever die and i have to invite her sibilings and i see them crying i will curse them and beat them because of one of my aunts telling a lie my grandpa or the fkin asshole that should rot in hell he told my mom to get on her knees one day and he put on some steel tipped boots and kicked her back out on her graduation day from highschool she couldnt walk hes kept her from going out with her sisters and so many other things he is a real asshole i hate him and he hates me my mom my step dad and my lil bro even my real dad left when i was young and he is an ass ya he used to pick me up and be with me but he was always busy with some other shit then instead of really spending time with me he has always been a smoker and drinks beer like there no tomorrow hes hurt me so many times and has filled me with promises that he immediately breaks afterward and has let me down on so many occasions he is the reason i started cutting and to be honest im just wating for him to diehe has lost so much weight and looks so thin really like a skeleton and im just waiting for him to die itz been 23 years when i havent really spent time with him and i refuse to call him or txt him unless we need the child support check from him recently his mom died i didnt realy care his famiy doesnt approve of me they call me fat and do not like that i dont eat spicy food they also dont like my mom and his mom treated my mom bad he guilted me into spending time with him he cried and everything i felt really bad so i had no choice but to be with him hes even forgotten my birthday and doesnt really even know me the only thing i can thank him for is getting me into sfx make up thats about it and i know people think its no big deal who cares he forgot ur bday but hispanics or at least my family are known for parties or bday parties and when i was with my dad it was because of my cuzins or families bdays they never did things for my bday like for my family members i adore my step dad i love him like he was my real dad he takes cares of me and truly cares for me he is my moms knight in shining armor and i tell him more than i tell my mom i trust him i really do his family accepts me but his mom and my mom clash heads alot the only thing is they dont

401,43206,okay people this might be a long one and it might be a little disjointed because im trying to gather my thoughts together im a 20 year old male will be 21 in july and i believe i have a case of an nmom i believe i know for a fact my mom has always resented me since birth because i wasnt meant to happen she stated that and because she tried putting me up for adoption and the only reason why i wasnt sent to an adoption home is because my great grandma who was adopted kid intervened and didnt want me to live a similar life to what she lived i was told this in 10 grade and my mom dosent know i know this and with that info it explains how she treats me compared to my older brother and in general so lets summarize my life and give an in depth description of my situation throughout my entire life my mom has always treated my brother better then me and has had an overall bias for him whether it be buying him new clothes and giving me hand me downs which occurred all the way up til 11 grade due to me getting a job or just by the way she handled problems differently between us i would get more severe punishments another thing is shes never really payed any attention to me she saids i had good grades but i had a 25 gpa in highschool which ill explain and i feel she takes out her anger on me due to her being in an abusive marriage and being diagnosed with bipolar and a few other things first let me explain my highschool situation and then well fast forward a bit so in highschool in my freshman year literally the first day of school i had the most embrassing thing happen to me and because of this its changed my life and shaped me as a person on the first day of highschool in art class i pissed my shorts it was so bad i skipped the next day of school but my brother told me that there was no escaping it because everybody was talking about it so he really didnt want to associate himself with me but he already didnt associate himself with me due to being around the wrong crowd and getting a felony in middle school so throughout my highschool life i was ridiculed and made fun and i just couldnt focus and i was afraid to talk to people because everyone knew it i was depressed and had no friends there due to just moving and to top it l off im black which i think race plays a part in your highschool life because theres so many stereotypes and people just trying to fit in so after highschool i proced to go technical school so i could transfer to a unviersty i was thinking about going into the military at the back of my mind as a last resort rember this when i was looking for colleges with my mom she was surprised that i had such a low gpa which goes to show you how much attention she had for me anyway i was only able to complete one semester of college due to the fact that my mom received an oppurtunity to transfer location for her job a verison wireless to altanta which she took because she took because she wanted to be connected with the music industry because she a manager and if you dont know a lot of black people speak highly of altanta so anyway im pretty much forced to go to altanta because just didnt have any other option because if not i would of ended up like my brother who decided not to come hes living in a one bedroom apt living cautious due to the job he has not paying much so im living in altanta now with my mom and not knowing the full situation until later because apprantly my mom was having half the rent payed by someone she was in a relationship with before which i thought was over because he was going to later move in lets just call him _person_ so im just living life coped in my room withering away because i have no one to talk to not getting any jobs due to never working and not being able to go to college due to having no ride or license or even a damn permit so it hit me i got to do something with my life because if not i wont be shit age 18 so after 6 months of living in ga with nothing going for me i decided i wanted to join the navy which i already brought it up to my mom previously so i take the asvab and scored an 82 and was given a pact firemen job which i didnt want but took anyway due to the fact i needed to get out my situation because nobody was helping me so the entire time this is happening my mom starts agitated due to the fact she probably knew the reason that i was leaving because of her so throughout this period of waiting to get deployed she would start arguements with me and not take me to my dep meeting forcing my petty officer to so i finally get into basic training and realized that this life wasnt for me so i tried to push myself but the thing that caught me was i didnt know how to swim and because of that i was in boot camp for 4 months and emotionally broke down and got seperated so when i made that phone call to my mom telling her what happen she was all supportive which i think was just an act because it was more of relief to her that i tried to do sonething but failed and that i have to depend on her so after being seperated im back at my moms house and to my surprise my uncle is here and _person_ my mom told me she wanted me to relax on jumping straight into something and that she would help me once i decided to get back into things so after living there for a few weeks i realized everything wrong with the situation of my mom moving to altanta because constantly my mom and _person_ would argue and _person_ would bring up the fact he was paying half the rent while not even living in the house and the fact my mom would never claim they were in a relationship publicly and whenever either one wasnt around they would talk shit about each other behind each other backs to my uncle also when they would argue _person_ would not pay rent out of spite the whole time im just the non existent one fast forward to my current situation my mom ends up getting in a relationship with another dude while she was still clinging on to _person_ using him for rent so _person_ just saids fuck it and moves out and lost all contact with my mom now lets get to the bs since my mom is with her new boyfriend lets call him _person_ she has made it very apprant that she dosent like me by talking shit about me to _person_ my brother _person_s two daughters and my uncle and when ask her for help she saids youll get no where in life depending on people because she knows i need her help and shes going out of her way to not help me its gotten worse because i confronted her about how she talks shit about me she responded with im just venting my ass and isnt really trying to help me and how its because of her that my brother just ignores me which didnt work out because this n just disregarded all the points i made and said i disrespected her and proceded to tell my brother my uncle and _person_ just so they can have a reason to not help me and to justify the way she treats me so pretty since my nmom has a stable source of income to leech on she no longer feels the need to pretend to care about me because before with _person_ she still needed me just i case everything hit the fan so what the fuck do i do i literally have nothing sorry for the long story and disjointness if there is anything you dont understand need more info on just tell me hazeto summarize mom never really liked me i tried going to the miltaty to get away emotionally broke down and got seperated came back and is now dealing with my mom slandering me behind my back and giving people reasons to hate me to justify her reasons of treating me this way then ive never had a job i never got a drivers license i dont have a car and my mom cant take me to technical college and i cant go to a university because of my low gpa and not taking an act or satin 20 minutes july 29 will be my birthday if you dont remember me i made this post _url_ also more negative stuff has happened since then my mom saying she doesnt care about my situation and i need to get the f out then dening she said that and slapping me in the face and she still is constantly shit talking about me i have nothing i can do i honestly feel like killing myself on my birthday really dont see any other options at this point,-1559.63,636.2,654.05,0.0,7.4,54.0

this isnt just one oh my payment failed i suck thing this happens all the time things that immediatly work for others i always have to jump through 500 fucking hoops to get anywhere as if i was flagged when i was born to always be a failure well jokes on you fate im tired of feeling like shit all the time i cant remember the last time i was happy im just a waste of space day by day it makes more and more sense my dreams and hopes are bullshit its all pointlessedit my captcha is buygon thats interestingi seriously have no desire to do anything anymore im unemployed and live with my

negative has been your friend for so long i guess im done i have no value and no drive to improve myself so whats the point why am i even posting this one of you once said you cant force me to improve myself if i dont want to so why cant i just diei usually get upset when i think of killing myself but today is different it almost seems logicali have nothing im a loser im not rich nor tall nor handsome i dont have charisma women are repelled by me frankly i dont care how family would react anymore if that makes me selfish or an asshole or scum i dont know what to say actually thats been my reaction to everything lately i dont want to die really but i dont want to bother living either i mean seriously what is the point my grades suck i cant make decent money im a bitter social retard if by some miracle i did make friends and get a girlfriend well that just brings even more problems the only problem is i dont have a gun handyhere i am going back to the city going back to my mom who will no doubt tell me i need to find a job and go to college who thinks that because i am suddenly on a campus or at a job i will be happier that girls will come with the job that things will work out in five years i cant wait around for five fucking yearsthe revelation was when i was at the bar the other day other people have no problem with social contact making friends chasing girls dating etc i just felt awkward and out of place i dont have confidence i dont have social proof i was standing at the bar and two girls seemed to laugh at mei dont know people i dont have any skills except computers i dont even have an interest in that field anymore frankly i get annoyed when family asks why im so sad they say things are wonderful things are not wonderfulmeanwhile i read stories im dating her i almost got arrested there i went to vegas with my friends im having doubts sw doubts this will ever change ive always been shy what chance in hell do i have of being the charismatic guy people love whatever motivation i have is quickly lost so why waste anyones time and moneyas an aside this is somewhat ironic as about a year ago i was wishing to know what it felt like to be numb because i thought it was better than feeling like shit all the time i guess now i knowim in my early 20s i feel like my life is on autopilot no wants no desires no motivation theres a tiny part that wonders what if things were better what if i could travel or make money or meet people or have a relationship with a nice girl what if i had social skills so i wouldnt be a bumbling idiot around people what if i didnt have severe social anxiety unfortunately the majority thinking is more along the lines of why bother this will fail youre an alien to the outside world among other things like

417,45072,hi guys im just going to lay it out since my writing goes to hell when im in this sort of state im 28 i have suicidal depression social anxiety general anxiety self harm im 100lb overweight down from 200lb horribly abusive family and last but worst ocd tactile hypersensitivity to make a long story short the inability to tolerate feelings like the seams in clothing has gutted my lifebecause of the above reasons high school almost killed me shortly after graduating and after a particularly bad family fight i got on a train and moved cross country to the west coast hoping that distance and a big new city would give me the chance i needed to live a real life 3 months later i found that separation anxiety from the abusive family was crippling me with panic attacks and i moved home i really cant explain it other than weve all seen the cops tv shows where the woman is battered and bloody and refuses to press charges on the guy that did it because maybe if she does just the right thing maybe then hell love her its like that i guess so i came home i had enough sense in me to know i couldnt come back to my familys house so i moved in with extended family who was close they treated me mostly the same and after 4 years of that long time i know but punishment is what i know i took off again to the east coast with the same hopes of a real life falling apart this time at 4 months and coming home this time to the original family house ive been back for 2 years now and its worse than ever i spend 22 hours a day in a room in the basement crying from panic attacks and cutting myself to shreds the other 2 hours i face the family which gives me enough punishment to do another 22 hours herei dont ever see it getting better for me ive run to both ends of the country and failed both times if i make it long enough ill run again but i know how that ends i just got a disability letter partially approving me but i dont even care because even if i could get the money to move myself away it would just be another room to sit and die inuntil the anxiety drove me home again the only thing i even really want in life honestly was a relationship someone to love and be loved by having never really felt it before i have it so built up in my head that it must be wonderful but being 100lb overweight having no career and no money and social anxiety that leaves me shaking and sick if i even try to say hi to someone i dont think ill ever have that and if i cant have it theres no real consolation prize that is worth staying around for ive wanted to die since i was 14 im utterly ashamed that ive spent 14 more years wanting it and not doing it while making almost no forward progress on fixing myself and i have tried to fix myself ive been in therapy for 7 years been on 2 dozen anti depressants tried every support group ive been able to ive got a self help library that will thrill the local library when they inherit it i had bariatric surgery and lost 70 of the 100 pounds i mentioned before nothing has ever removed the lump in my throat every morning that ive woken up for 14 years has hurt to realize im alive for another day for the first time in my life i got a reprieve 3 months ago its crazy but bear with me after reading a study from johns hopkins on magic mushrooms treating depression i tried it myself and got similar results within 2 days i felt what i imagine normal happy people must feel like all the time i wasnt sad i was just ok and after having been sad most of my life being ok was the best feeling ive ever felt i still had all of the real problems i listed but i felt like the sky was the limit i was going to work my ass off and fix these things and surely within 2 or 3 years i was going to have that life i spent so much time fantasizing about i bought a bike and put 1000 miles on it in 2 months and lost 30 more lb for 2 months i didnt cry once or use a single ativan for a panic attack it physically felt like there was a burden lifted from me being alive didnt feel like walking through mud anymore but optimism alone doesnt save you when everything around you wants to tear you down christmas kicked my ass my family had no tolerance for this new up beat person and worked double time to hurt him it worked i lost the grip i had on my new happiness at 3 months i tried the mushroom thing again and it has not worked as well as before maybe a little but then im still writing this letter tonight after all its left me heartbroken to have seen the light and had it pried out of my hands and what is there left to try to get it back which by the way is my most important question here what do i have left to try im 28 with nothing even if i had that happiness back and it stayed i would be 30 something before i ever had a life and i dont see how someone can make a real life at that point it would be more of a patchwork _person_ in the shape of a real life anyway ive droned on too long anyway sorry for beating you with a wall of text if youve made it this far i can add to it in replies if needed i just need to know at what point do we cash in our chips and figure its not going to get better so lets just stop the suffering how does someone in my position this late in life salvage anything worthwhile out of ittldr im 28 and have never had a life too broken to make one and treatment is not healing me at what point is it too latei dont want to ask in rasklegal because theyll get hung up on the wrong part of the question if i thought there was something that could be said to prevent the suicide in the first place id be asking that instead i dont have much to leave behind i would like to leave one friend my camera and hard drive full of my work then my laptop to another friend but neither lives close enough to get it themselves it would have to be mailed and then finally i wanted to be cremated and have my ashes sent to the first friend theyve agreed the problem is my family wont be cooperative with any of it they wont want to give up items they could keep themselves and they certainly wont respect the cremation or giving the ashes away how do you enforce any of it it seems like once the police take the body away the apartment will just be left alone and the next people to come in will be my family who can then just tear up a will and throw it away or take the items and say they never saw them same goes with the ashes the coroner will ask the family what they want done and theyll tell him their wishes not minedoes anyone know how this would work out i guess i could take care of part of it by mailing the items myself before hand but i feel like when i finally get the nerve the time between deciding to do it and doing it will be too quick to get side tracked with mailing stuff tomorrow also it would probably be too painful to send it all away myselfim 28 now the depression became suicidal at 14 life wasnt very good before that and i dont remember much before 10 ive wanted to die for almost all of my memorable life i work so hard at getting better but its not really getting better because i was never ok to begin with i dont even know what its like to feel like a normal person to think that now in what would be the middle of a normal life im going to pull it all together and be able to do all of the things ive never been able to do how realistic is thatbesides the depression i deal with ocd social anxiety normal anxiety and a horrible family since i was little it left me too scared of people to have friends and too tormented by the ocd to do much but stay home and hide and that family and the anxiety to tear me apart while i did that college was out of the question for the same reasons but eventually i felt that if i could just get away from the damage the family was doing i could be happy i tried twice at 20 and 24 i moved to either end of the country i fell apart both times within 3 months i dont know why a lot of anxiety i suppose and at this point im a codependent on that messed up family i moved out for a 3rd time and im 3 month into it now i dont want to go home but its made me realize something worse i finally got out and separated myself from them and nothing is any better i live off of a little savings that will eventually run out i worry constantly about the money its not the ocd that keeps me in anymore but the cost of going out and the anxiety of it all anyway i cant find a job im not cut out for anything but washing dishes and even that causes a breakdown after a few weeks because of the ocd im too depressed to work on my own business that takes so much from even a normal person i was crazy to think i could do it and most importantly i still cant have a relationship or even friends even if there were places for me to go im too scared of people to do anything other than sit at the side and avoid them i have such big fantasies of finding love and its ridiculous because i cant even say hi to a personlooking back it was easier to be in that messed up household with the family because i could always tell myself itll be better as soon as you get out it was something to keep hope alive now that im out and still as crippled as ever what do i tell myself itll get better if you just give it 6 months i told myself that at 16 that it must get better there was no way a person could feel like this for years and years and now here i am more than a decade later feeling the same way i still tell myself that theres no way i could possibly be 40 or 50 and still be like this but i find threads on reddit all the time of 40 and 50 year olds talking about their lifelong depressionso many huge things about me that would have to change to feel better when ive never even made progress on a single one im going to be that 50 year old talking about how he was depressed since 14 or maybe not the money is going to run out in a year and i wont even be able to be that 50 year old no part of me believes i will ever be better i never have been ive never seen anyone like me that has gotten better i havent even seen many like me that have lived this long you dont go 14 years wanting to die you get better or you kill yourself much sooner than thatwhat the hell do i do everyone wants to just say keep hanging on itll get better but i do and it doesnt how long are you supposed to hang on and keep fooling yourself into thinking itll ever be better and would it matter if i grit my teeth and live another 30 years so i can die of old age crying all the way my life is over it never started i knew that at 14 i was just too conflicted to kill myself because i hoped there would be some proof that it could get better thats what keeps me here now because what if something happens tomorrow to change everything so i struggle to tomorrow and nothing happens at what point am i allowed to give up and i sit here now writing this hoping someone can say something to help but there is nothing in 14 years of this ive heard it all and none of it has helped theres just nothing left,-2170.66,871.0,894.57,0.0,6.88,63.0
418,45096,ive been reading this subreddit for a while now and i realise my problems are nowhere near as serious as a lot of the posts here and i genuinely feel bad for these people i just have no idea what i could possibly say to help them feek better and unlike the other posts here which have a degree of bad circumstances its pretty much 100 my own fault i finished highschool and went to college like pretty much any youth and thats pretty much when everything fell apart first year went fine then i failed in 2nd year then i failed in 3rd year again and again im 25 now and i still have no bachelor i tried finding programming jobs a few months and a few years ago but everything just feels like its there to expose what a fraud i am even opening netbeans or another ide it just feels like its there to expose what a fraud i am i sometimes have small outbursts of honest work yesterday i managed to figure out how to read a rss feed into java but not too much when i used to go to an interview my only thought was time to show again what an imposter i am living off minimum wage in this country is unsustainable and my parents are miserable because of my situation i honestly feel that its too late for me to fix anything anymore and any effort i make is just a baby step compared to the giants that are my peers killing myself doesnt feel like a tragic episode but more like a darwinian one weaklings like me are expelled from society i am terribly shamed for my family and even throwing my life away just feels like too little a punishment i also filed an euthanasia request to my family doctor and he rejected it i have no gun so just jumping from the 10th floor where i live seems like the only optionhelloi realize some people might recognize me for adviceinput of low and medium quality i throw around here the truth is i have become a regular here because the feelings end up being overwhelming i already have another thread here but i hope its not too selfish to make another one it feels like shouting out in a great dark void where nothing gets outanyway im 25 now eastern europe and i have nothing to myself being pretty lonely as a child my best friends were video games i wanted to create other best friends for other people when i would grow up so after i graduated high school i got in at a computer science faculty as a person i almost never take decisions if that makes any sense i always walk around with my hands stretched out and if someone wants to grasp it and pull me on their side i follow i guess thats why i liked almost every object of study in highschool and accepted every seminar or whatever that someone walked up and offered to me including religious ones i end up feeling that this modum esse ended up hurting me more in the long run first year of college everything went fine but second year everything went downhill and really fast really bad all the friends i made dropped out the new professors had a very different attitude and i just ended up feeling alienated i believe this is the 6th year of college in a 3 year program and my parents said theyd rather not support this endeavor anymore somehow i passed to 3rd but i still have stuff left from 2ndim also starting to feel weird when im at some place that im not intimate with whenever i would have to turn in homework my heart would pump out really hard my head would start asking itself questions repeatedly and i start being afraid that i would be exposed as a fraud i went out with people i dont know and one of my two friends to a place i dont know needless to say i felt terrible i would sweat constantly always playing with my cigarettes or my lighter randomly playing with my phone etc i dont think i said a word that nighti tried getting a job programming companies rejected me all the time probably because i dont know too much due to my modum esse last interview i had was for a java developer position i was shocked to see i only got 42 of their questions correct which brings me to my next issue is that i forget a lot stuff that i knew at some point are slowly fading out of my memory when they shouldnt be i thought i knew _person_ at least on an intermediary level seems that was not the case programming a massive project by myself feels incredibly scary i dont even know where i would start the only job i managed to hold was as a database manager for some mail delivery company i had three bosses which abused the living hell out of me calling me names mocking me asking questions about my intimate life until i couldnt take it anymore and i just quit home i was berated by my family for doing thathome doesnt feel like home anymore ive been berated so many times for playing games or watching movies or tv shows on my computer i cannot get any enjoyment from them even when im alone at home i jog some evenings when i dont feel completely exhausted and during warm evenings i go to the park and play chess or backgammon with lonely old men a kind redditor suggested to me to try to go teach english in other places i tried looking up for an english test and theyre pretty expensive but at least its something to think about something i can latch toever since i started to feel this insane pressure coming from multiple sides ive been thinking about suicide since to be fair it never gets better by itself unless some angel comes and i dont have strength to carry on anymore i feel like something that should have been rightfully mine has been given away to someone else even my girlfriend got tired of me and dumped me and my meaningless existence i feel an unchanneled thirst for revenge some kind of spite for society and the way it treated me i tried talking about it to other people first about the suicide to test the waters and then about the strange feelings im experiencing i tried bringing it up to my family mother doesnt even want to hear about it father ridicules me my little cousin 21 thinks im someone who says it for attention am i and if i really wanted to do it i would would i not even my two dear dear friends really understand me one of them ridicules me for my feelings of revenge and the other one just listens doesnt offer any input at all in the end all i am is a walking joke and it only makes sense to put my existence away i live at the 10th floor maybe after a few too many shots in a bad night i could bring myself to do it since im literally too stupid to know how to find barbs or any other convenient method i realize my problems are nothing compared to what other people here are facing and that i am taking away precious first page space for people who truly are in dire straits and not complete fuck ups like me if youre down here and you read all this even without feeling a connection to it

420,45266,edit skip to the second to last paragraph the one starting with the word first if you wish to help but dont want to read the rest of my rantjust fucking failed my second calc exam _person_ every other class no problem but this one is preventing me from doing anything i may even have to drop to class to not destroy my gpa my parents are going to freak out on mebut i have 2 exams and a lab report due tomorrowthe thing is that this only applies to the classes im taking now the classes i took last semester were reading and writing intensive i do poorly by my own standards i cant seem to focus to be able to read through an assignment sometimes finding a video lecture helps but that isnt always an option sometimes the material is to in depth and specific for what im trying to get out of it like trying to do calcbased physics and only finding videos pertaining to algebraic physics an internet addiction doesnt help much eitheri really want to be a doctor or pa at the least also considering engineering but with calculus fucking me over fat chance i dont have that great of grades due to a bad first semester right now i do some low level work in emergency medicine working on becoming an emt i absolutely love volunteering for that stuffmy parents are some of the smartest idiots i know i know they really care about me and want what is best for me but sometimes what is best for me is just really fucked up i can recall one time that so my parents knew but wasnt really the case that i hadnt had a girlfriend in a while my best friend at the time was dating this girl she tried cheating on him with me my parents found out and thought i should go for it she even sent me nudes needless to say i didnt go for it and i told him about it their advice has meant little to me ever sincei am lucky enough despite being 55 and 250lbs this one doesnt bother me that much to find myself an attractive girlfriend the only problem is that we are on such different intellectual levels during our senior years of highschool i was 5 years ahead of her math wise we have little common interest the thing about this that pisses me off the most is that the crowd she hangs out with an i do sometimes ill ask her to do something and she will flat out refuse when her friends ask she goes for it and then invites me kind of pisses me off that they have more pull than me she also kind of sort of cheated on me my friends and i just finished the movie smiley which for some reason prompted her to get on omegle she started talking to a guy on skype she left herself logged in on my phone he sent her a message i went through the history and she referred to me ask her ex this was on the 4th of july i found out one year exactly since i met her and 2 days before out 1 year fortunatly or not i couldnt get time off work from mcdonalds night shift so i told her i found out and left for my 10 hour shift my parents told me she didnt really cheat since it was just some random guy she met online and she didnt do anything physically and said i should stay with her well i did i havent cared about our relationship much since i sometimes feel like the only thing driving our relationship is sex weve been together for 1 year and 8 monthsnow that i am in college i have few friends we rarely have time to see eachother well im free theyre not i went most of my first semester friendless and now my friends just have no time for me being generally socially awkward doesnt help much either i recently tried going to my schools anime club just to find out i wasnt as into it as they arethis semester i have a room to myself but last semester i had a roomate because i had no friends i knew no one was knocking for me nothing pissed me off more than when he wasnt in the room and someone knocked on the door every time i said hes not here without opening the door rage soured through me i had little problem with the experience of having no friends it was being reminded that hurt it also doesnt help that i quit playing online video games with my friends because i was too much of a cheap bastard to bother buying a membership when i got back to my room i started doing some violent things to myself i realize or at least hope i can cut my losses and make it throughi would like some help with resources and have various questions on the matterfirst i see that there are plenty of places to call but i personally loathe phone calls is there anything text based resources wise some website i can go to to get paired with a councilersecond i found my insurance card i know my university accepts my insurance my question is how can i make as little a paper trail to follow as possible if my parents find out it will only make things worse someone once called the cops to do a wellness check on me when i was 13 the result of that was 6 trips to the psychologist and 4 trips to the psychiatrist psychologist and i got no where for the psychiatrist my mother was always in the room and it felt as though he was just prescribing things at her will based on what she thought i had despite good grades in high school one of the first things i got put on was adhd medication it only made me upset my mother wanted me to stay on it because it was supposed to aid in weightloss then antidepressents they made me lack the ability to feel any emotion it was kind of nice looking

421,45351,it seems that all i think about is death and how much i would like to be dead i dont necessarily think i would kill myself hence the title but im not quite sure what i am capable of when i am in my dark zone as i call it when i am left to my thoughts my mind is clouded and i feel as if everyone has left the earth and i remain wondering where everyone went i think of mainly death and self harm and other things i dont want to go into detail with i do have times where i am happy i laugh and sometimes smile and have good thoughts but the time between these moments feel like they are infinitely long and my heart literally feels as if it is going to collapse and then there are times where i am extremely angry at everyone and everything for no reason and i know there is no reason but i still feel this hatred this also leads to dark thoughts but again i dont wish to go into them at this moment after a rather unpleasant encounter with a group of girls in my old neighborhood i accidentally sent my mom a text that led to me telling her i have social anxiety issues she sent me to some christian therapist not to mention i was hiding everything else and still do to this day that is all i remember of him because that is all it seemed to be advertised although i do remember how he liked to talk a lot about himself he asked me something about my baseball team i think if i was friends with any of them or something and i said i rarely talk to them his response was well go talk to them i was there because i said i had social anxiety issues and the first thing he said to me was that he doesnt prescribe medication at that point i had enough of him and lied to my mom saying that i was all better a last ditch effort after 3 visits and she believed me a year later when i got the courage to ask if i could see someone else i wanted to see a psychiatrist that i choose she proceeded to yell at me for lying and that was the end of me ever wanting to seek help from a professional especially because i am afraid they will pass information on to my mom that i dont want her knowingnow that i identify as transgender and atheist i feel i must hide all that i am from my family and most everyone else making things worse then in my dark moments i question myself as to what i really think i am making myself extremely confused as to what i really believe like am i just identifying as transgender because i really believe it or do i want some bit of attention from those that i do tell i am going into my senior year of high school with no idea what to do after i graduate how i will survive in a world that i am deeply afraid of now that my mom is pressuring me to move to arizona i have to choose between a whole new state and surroundings or being left on my own in a way where it would be difficult to live on my own mainly financially but if i dont deal with my mom or cut her out of my life soon i feel like she will absolutely drive me to kill myself not intentionally but through complete ignorance that hurts mei feel there is so much wrong with me that i cant quite put into words that amount to the conclusion that everyone is better off with me dead including myself i dont know what i was hoping to get out of this a place to vent words to keep me going or something else i am walking uphill into a fog i cant hope to see through driven by some force i cant understand but can feel is breaking under my weight i dont know what to do what will happen if i am with the means to end myself at the wrong or right time im sorry if i am just wasting everyones time,-644.1,284.5,293.7,0.0,6.76,55.0

445,47817,everyones always told if they are suicidal they should get help im reminded of this often but what are they really going to do for me i know they arent going to solve any of my problems nobody is going to really solve my problems nobody is going to rewind time and erase whats been done to me nobody is going to volunteer to put money in my pocket so what is the point of telling a professional youre suicidal to me it seems totally counterproductive like the only people who would contact these crisis lines are the people i despise people who claim they are suicidal but just want attentioni dont want attention i just want to fucking die already i want to crawl into a hole and die because anything beats continuing to bear the situation i am in right now and the worse direction it is headingso if instead of ending my life i decide to call one of these people and ask for help first what are they really going to do for me besides remove my one last option that is guaranteed to free me from sufferingive sought help for depression already from more than one source and between different doctors medications and therapists ive concluded that i basically cant be fixed i should just get over it and force myself to accept that life is basically going to be shit for me and i should instead be happy about that fact and look forward to my future well i know that is a load of shit and i dont have a future and i never really felt that i didi think i am doing everyone a favor here i tried to get help and gave it a big effort and gave it several big chances but im over 30 now and back at square one i think its safe to conclude i cant be fixed and its better for everyone if the doctors and other valuable people spend their time on someone who can be saved instead of a lost cause like me,-265.85,137.0,141.66,0.0,8.21,60.0
446,48007,my story started the 4th of january 2013 it hasnt been going great for a long long time 23 years and i knew i was strugging my girlfriend at the time _person_ knew i was struggling as well i broke up with her 2 days prior to this as i just no longer saw a future i did not have any feelings left and felt empty i couldnt sleep for the longest time until it hit me it was me i was the person that had a problemin a moment of panic and realisation what i had done i called my _person_ awake and went over to her place in tears panic i spilled my story as best as i could for that moment and begged her to come back to me we decided we would give it another shot and i would go look for help i managed to find help someone to talk to every week we had meetings and talked about things but it didnt feel like i was hitting the core of my issues we then decided i would go to another psychologist she advised me who specliased in system therapy not knowing what i would get myself into i accepted and went there it didnt take him very long to crack me i can safely say i experienced the worst pain agony and grief that i had ever felt within 15 minutes of walking in there to cut a long story a bit shorter there i have a deceased brother who died at the age of 6 months he died years before i would be born but the long lasting effects of such tragedy my parents never managed to deal with it and being the next boy to be born i carried the burden i was not only being myself i was also my older brother i acted cared protected as if i were 2 persons i was literally keeping the family together my sisters each had their own boatload of trouble during their puberty my father eventually broke down and spent 3 months internally to get mental help my mother well she never managed to get over the loss of her first son finally after more then 9 months after the 4th of january i managed to finally start working on getting a healthy relationship with my mother this basically boiled down to me not being allowed to listen to her problems i was no longer allowed to be the person in her life my dad had to reinvent that out of all the things that happened out of all the things that managed to change in that period this was the only thing i think lasted i literally care for people i protect people i listen to endless amounts of storiesproblems from people because that is what i learned to do i learned to listen take it all up and then tell people it would get better hell i learned how to give advice and perhaps that caused more people to empty their hearts to me in the end i simply cannot give anymore im tired just so tired even after completing all those sessions learning things about how people work learning about how i work i was just exhausted i could no longer give care or anything i eventually broke up with _person_ after all the hell weve been through it was harsh it was 1sided and at the time seemed like the best thing to do i simply did not have the energy to be in this relationship we were perfect for eachother i was raised to care for people she lost her father at an early age and was looking for a father figure it was perfect but unhealthy i had to get out even though she is the person that i want to marrywe are now what 9 months later and things were going for the worse it went really good for some time i managed to pick up my study economics teacher i managed to get some energy back and everything seemed fine but things happened and it changed me first off was _person_ a lovely girl a few years older she has a relationship but was looking for some adventure at first i thought i was doing something right but after making out several weeks outside her apartment i started to realise what was happening i wasnt seducing this girl i was her escape from her misserable relationship voilá 3 weeks later her friend had chirgury to reduce the headaches has recovered from that and is feeling great again guess what way the attention went ill save you the details on other things that happen but one thing never changed plenty of people wanted my attention plenty of people wanted to speak out their problems they wanted someone that listens to them and helps them get through it still knowing what happens i cannot resist its who i am or at least who i think i amover the weeks that came after i just started slipping i know what is happening to me i know exactly what is happening im having a fullblown fallback that exact feeling is coming back to me and its terrifying but its different previously i was just afraid i was scared i was angry and i didnt understand this time however i do understand i am full aware of what is happening to me and i think i stopped caring last saturday i went out with several people and it was a fun night plenty happened with the people i was out with but i just snapped something in my mind said fuck this i have been scared angry and all those things but now i just dont believe it will improve i emptied my heart to a friend of mine and she basically said no you are not going to end yourself i will not allow it and that did great things to me it did me great i felt new energy for a few hours it didnt last longwhat followed were the worst days of fear i had ever lived i am afraid when i wake up i am afraid to go to bed if i dont hypnotize myself with some dumb game or activity i can only think about how mad i am how sad i am how i dont believe in any person willing to help me i fantasise about walking across the highway i want to feel what it is like to have my life hanging in the palm of my end i embrace the feeling of ending it i refuse to i m not going to i think but these thoughts have been the warmest thoughts i have had in a long time it is as death is the person i love and cherish its like something is welcoming me to release of all this pain this grief this never changing cycle but you know i still had people out there i still had a few people that i trust that if i were to be in real pain or trouble i could talk to so i texted _person_ the one person above everyone else that i trust she promised me when we broke up that if there was ever a problem or something like this that she would be there she made me promise to tell her and shed be there out of all the people in the world if i was about to kill myself _person_ was the one i should call and she just didnt respond she saw my messages she knows very well what is happening to me and she doesnt care enough to listen 8 days from now i turn 25 i live in a world that does not care about the people around them if there is any chance of them not having to listen to others they will take it they will opt out because they are unable to listen i live in a world where a person will not return the favor that you did oh so very often for them i live in a world that would rather say at the funeral why didnt we listen to him then to actually pay attention to what is happening not to long ago i read gt some people are already death they just dont know it yet i am not going to commit suicide i died the 4th of january 2013 its just a matter of time now when i decide my body should be buried,-1361.71,560.2,575.72,0.0,7.17,52.0

449,48291,ive struggled off and on with depression for the last decade but i always felt secure that suicide was never going to enter the equation i had this worldview that prevented those thoughts from ever coming upbut for the first time ever i feel as though it might be a good time to leave this world theres a lot of reasons why but what it all comes down to is that im tired really tired tired of searching for solutions tired to struggling tired of tryingi was going to see about getting student loans and going to get an engineering certificate so i could earn more than 10 an hour at a parttime retail job but i dont care anymore so what if i did i could never work fulltime im working 30 hours now and when i come home every day im so exhausted i can barely speak coherently all i do is come home feed the animals and then go to bed again 40 hours a week is not something i could ever doi thought about pursuing another dream of mine but by the time i get the money to do it ill be too old to enroll the dream is to try out the temporary monastic ordination program at a buddhist abbey in canada theres an age cutoff by the time i save up for it im sure id be beyond that limiti have a lot of other things id like to do and see nothing really crazy but i know ill never earn enough money to do so ill never earn enough to even get my teeth fixedi know i should go see a doctor to get a referral to a psychologist andor therapist and ive been down that road before but it didnt really lead anywhere while i was receiving help i felt great but it never lasted while i was talking to a therapist i would be lighthearted insightful optimistic i would feel great an hour later id feel good an hour after that id feel okay later on id feel dull and by the end of the day id feel like shit againbut as soon as my next therapy session came around id be all sunshine and positive attitude id have all the answers all the motivation all the drive and passion in that one room talking to a stranger then id leave that room and itd all evaporate like a dream i sought help and i got it but it was no good to meive thought about the people id hurt if i left my mom would be devastated i know she has her first grandchild through my younger brother now just a month old i figured my niece would be a good way for my mom to sublimate her grief new life to take the edge off the loss of mine my best friend who until six months ago was the man i was going to marry would be hurt because im sure he would never see it coming i dont want to hurt him but i know him hell be fine hell move on and hell continue to lead an enviable life full of friends and lovers and traveli thought that i could go on living for all these people in my life that i at least had the energy to do that even if my life was small and meaningless but i dont feel like i have the energy to do even that i cant think of any other way to sustain myself while still addressing my emotional needs i cant not work and still pay the bills and receive professional help and indulge in small joys here and thereim nearly 32 years old dont have a licensecar work in retail was kicked out of university and am in debt to student loans to the tune of 20k that i cant pay back ive missed years of income tax refunds that i cant figure out how to file nor can i afford the help to get them done even if i could i have a really bad memory i put the tax return forms right next to my laptop so i would remember to do them but despite that i just keep forgettingi want to be able to make life at home with my best friend better but i can never think of ways to help out around the house ill come home and hell have done something to improve our lives thats simple and obvious and i hate that i cant think creatively like that i just want to show him that im not neglectful i really want to help i just dont know howand all this struggle has really taken a lot out of me trying to get better has exhausted me and i dont feel like i have anything left ive reached that point of being perfectly at peace with leaving this world im at peace with the idea that i will completely cease to exist no afterlife it wouldnt even be rest because thered be no me to do any resting im okay with that i dont really care about resting anyway i just feel done and yet part of me is nagging me to write thisive been going through some difficulty and for about a month there things were looking up but i was just in denial about what i feel is the reality of my life i didnt want to face it because it hurt too much to accept but i cant fix anything if i dont face whats wrongand now that im facing whats wrong i can see no way out so rather than face a lifetime of poverty poor health and uselessness ive decided that im going to end my life i havent decided how yet but it is going to happen it has to happen i wont give myself any alternativesid like to thank reddit all of reddit never before have i been so inspired depressed

465,49714,hello you dont know me i come to you with a desperate plea because i have no friends to confide in so i must confide with strangers on the internet at least you guys seem to be an amiable bunch that are more likely to help out than tell me to kill myself which i have to admit has come across my mind more than a few times in the recent past ive posted this on another subreddit and i dont know your rules on multiple posting but if i dont get help soon i fear what i might doi need life advice ever since ive left high school my life has been nothing but a string of failure after failure i was originally accepted to the university of waterloo in ontario for an ambitious program that combined a computer science degree with an accounting degree i originally wanted to be just computer science but with influence from my accountant mother she encouraged me to take compsci with accountingi moved out then something in my head just switched in high school i was a responsible honor roll student who got all as with little to no effort when i moved out i just let go of everything all my classes started failing i got sucked into different computer games that sucked up all my time starting with _person_ then into league of legends after i moved out of the dorm without steady internet i realized how wretched of a person i could become i remember that after every class instead of going somewhere to study i went to one of the common rooms with my pc mouse and mousepad ready hooked up and just played league of legends until an ungodly hour before returning to my room to sleep ive also downloaded a porn game and fapped to it until 5 am in the morning making me unable to go to class the next dayafter a straight year of mediocre marks my parents and i agreed that maybe waterloo was too difficult of a university and that i should go to an easier university better to do well in a lesser university than to do bad in a good university rightwell moving to york university initially wasnt so bad i did get good marks initially but this year ive once again failed my parents and myself my league of legends addiction stayed causing me to play instead of studying causing me to bomb my midterms on two of my major courses causing me to drop one and end up getting a d in the other i never paid attention in class i was too proud and stupid to think that i needed to i would read that on my own i said to myself but i never did since my nights were filled with league since i also repeated an accounting course that i needed for an internship but didnt get the mark i needed last semester but since i kept forgetting to do online assignments and didnt pay attention in class i ended up getting a worse mark than before im very lucky that the internship office said that they could make exceptions if my gpa was high enoughnow with the beginning of my new semester my ol faithful asus laptop that fed my addiction to all of my video games for the past 4 years has died and ive managed to get some time to think about my life i decided that i would start paying attention in class start studying and stop playing so much games especially since the laptop i have now can only play shitty gameshowever my dad just talked to me about an hour before i typed this he and my mom have been nothing but supportive of me throughout my failure at waterloo but my recent failings has recently driven them over the edge my mom who was usually a taskmaster behind me in high school and my main motivation for getting good marks often came from her has become more dismissive and pessimistic about me and my schooling my dad picked up on this and after hearing about me fucking up last semester has issued an ultimatumif i dont start pulling my marks up and bs are probably not going to cut it he said that he no longer wanted to feel like a failure as a father and wants me to live alone for the past 20 years of my life he has offered nothing but support and fatherly advice but i have never done any of it i cant blame him for wanting to kick me out ive wasted so much money with my failure and appear to want nothing more but to play games all day and nighti dont know what to do i want to believe that i can study and do better in school but i dont know if i can at this point i have already promised myself the same thing multiple times in the past but i always seem to forget the strife and pain that i went through just a few months before and fall into old habitsive already feel guilty about all the shit ive put my parents through and its beginning to affect my head ever since ive failed those midterms last semester every time i go through any kind of emotional stress ive been getting these intrusive thoughts in my head maybe you should just kill yourself they say after i hear these things in my head i always find myself going down a train of thought analyzing the benefits of suicide how it would help my parents not have to feel as failures anymore and how i wouldnt have to worry about disappointing them anymore im scared of what my own mind is doing that is seemingly out of my controleven with suicidal thoughts and all of my parents efforts i am very afraid of falling back into the cycle of improving then forgetting and returning to old habits that will cause failure im lost i cannot tell anyone in my life about this all of my friends wouldnt know what to tell me and probably couldnt tell me much but basic uplifting tropes and shit i dont want to put all of my emotional baggage on them they dont deserve it they have their own lives to worry aboutthe only glimmer of hope i see is that i have been successfully working out at home using workout videos although most of my drive to get in shape was to get a pornstar body im really fucking motivated by sex for some reason its about the only good thing i have going for me hell that might be the only way i could make money when my dad kicks me out and i have to start whoring my self outplease i need help i need a third party to tell me what to do i keep seeing the pattern of my life but i just cant seem to break the cycle with my dad about to kick me out im really afraid that if i dont pull my marks up and turn myself around i may end up on the news no more than a year later as a dead man who hanged himself in a local alleyim not currently suicidal right now but i know that if i cant pull this life off soon i will have good reason to be any kind of advice is needed even if its just a redirection to a larger advice subreddit ive tried to
