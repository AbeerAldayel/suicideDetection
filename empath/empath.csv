There's no real preference to the girls I do approach, but for the successes I do have , it *seems* like I move too fast and ruin something down the line. Before you say that that's my problem, I've tried to read up on dating advice and even went so far as to shelling out about $200 or so to simplepickup.com for dating advice - don't get me wrong, they helped me have a much better success rate and everything - to no relationship lasting more than a couple weeks before they break up (lol). I'm not complaining or anything either, I just saw that there has been relationship advice that has been given and I was wondering if I was doing anything wrong or not.",141,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03546099290780142,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602835,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0,0.014184397163120567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014184397163120567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.0425531914893617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014184397163120567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0

I'm a 20 year old who is looking for my ""It Girl"" in life. Basically by that I mean a girl I can be best friends with while being in a relationship with her. I may be too young to some people, plus it may scare some away but that's really okay. I'm quite mature for my age and I'm actually ready for a deeper relationship than many who are in their 20s.      _PERSON_ _PERSON_ described it best when he sang his song.    &gt; You could be my it girl.  &gt; Baby you're the shit girl, loving you should be a crime.  &gt; Crazy how you fit girl  &gt; This is it girl  &gt; Gimme 25 to life            **About me**    * I am quite possibly the tallest Filipino you have seen (6'3"")  * I love all types of music! From country to rock, pop to rap, classical to EDM, anything goes really as long as I can jam to it! As for favorites, 90s or early 00s R&amp;B is my bread and butter.  * My tastes in movies and TV Shows are pretty much the same as music. I don't stick to one particular genre at all. If I watch Netflix, then one moment I can be watching Attack on Titan (I'm a nerd lol) and the next show could be Freaks and Geeks. I could be watching Enter the Dragon and the next movie coulld be the Notebook (Yes I actually quite like chick flicks). If I like the show or movie, I could care less about what it is. If I like it, then I like it.  * My parents raised me right. I know how to treat a lady. That's right. I will pay for dates, be a gentleman, hold your hand, come to your house when your sick and the most important one of all:  * **I will listen** to you. Yes, you ~~heard it~~ read that right.  * To not waste anybody's time, here's a [pic of me](_URL_ Don't judge...I'm sick at the moment lol. You should see how I am when I'm [cleaned up](_URL_ c;  * **CUDDLING** I am very much pro cuddling. Just be sure to brace yourself because I can be a Cuddle Monster at times *Badum pshhh*...nevermind.  * Which leads me to my next reason, humor! It doesn't take much to make me laugh. So even stupid things like Nyan Cat get a chuckle from me.        **What I'm into**  I'm into alot of things. When it's sunny, you will find me outside alot of the time exploring cities and walking around. When it's gloomy, you'll find me inside on my computer. If I'm on a date, then you can expect something casual with a romantic flair thrown in from time to time (i.e. Hang out at Greenlake and end the date watching the sunset).        **I will have to warn you about one thing**. I am a professional Call of Duty player (Yes the game..). So you may find me on my Xbox sometimes for tournaments, but if something's more important I tend to drop it.      **tl;dr** Look, the bottom line is this. Hi. My name is _PERSON_ and I would love to get to know you. I don't like judging people and I am a very loving person.

4,27fi22,10146,2014-06-06 00:29:34,CodAW,"This may have been done to death, but *my thoughts* on what should be in AW","*This will be a long post. I apologize in advance c:*         **League Play**  Black Ops 2 helped out the competitive Call of Duty scene in a way that it allowed normal people to play against other people using the pro rule sets without having to go through GameBattles. Don't have another ""Clan vs Clan"" where it counts towards your Public Match stats either.         **Higher TTK**  Ghosts ALMOST had it right. If the TTK was the same as Black Ops 2 or other CoDs before it, then most people wouldn't bash it as much as they have.         **More dedicated servers**  The Xbox One has about 300,000 servers. With tons of people upgrading to the next gen systems for this next game, please make use of the added servers. It would make it so that people can actually play without too much lag compensation. That and the game would be less connection based.         **Hit Detection**  I love the hit detection in Ghosts... Keep it that way.         **Gun Balance**  Self explanatory. Instead of having 1 or 2 dominant weapons, make it so that you can run around with ALMOST anything and at least have fun with it. Competitive is one thing, there has to be banned items, but in pubs make it more balanced, please.         **""CoD style maps""**   3 main lanes of traffic with buildings and debris thrown in here and there (Not too many though). While you're at it, make it so you don't have to watch every angle at all times when you go into a room. In a map like Sovereign, if you go to the B Flag in Domination, you literally have to watch from everywhere. Caution, nest, divider, research and underground... Not to mention grenades flying everywhere.         **LAN Support**  Self explanatory.         **Scorestreaks not Killstreaks**   Once again, Black Ops 2 had a superior advantage over Ghosts here. People don't have an incentive to play for the objective and you have people camping close to flags instead of capping. If you could implement Specialist in the scorestreak system (i.e. Perk 1 is 500-700 points, Perk 2 650-800, Perk 3 850-1000, Specialist 1000-1500) it would be great.         **Theater Mode**  Ghosts took a huge step backwards with the removal of this.         **C4s and Claymores/Bouncing Betties/IEDs**  I don't mind any of these things personally. But make them less effective. Give them a bit more of a delay before they explode, lessen the damage, do something so people can't rely on these for half of their kills.         **Lock on Launcher**  Please bring back the Stinger or whatever you want to name it. I'm tired of hiding when there's an enemy helicopter.         **No Marksman rifle class**  They're more of a nuisance now.         **Customization**   Once again, Ghosts had this right. The character customization is amazing. But make it so we don't have to spend $4 for a character though...         **Volume Sliders**  I know you worked hard on the soundtrack and the codcaster voice, but please for the love of God let this happen. I play with the sound turned wayyy up in SND and whenever the music comes on or I'm the last alive, I nearly get a heart attack.         **GET RID OF THE AMPLIFY/AWARENESS PERK**  Please. It only serves as a cheap perk.         **MW2 Style unlocking system**  Headshots for camos, kills with attachments to unlock other attachments, NO points. They're literally useless once you reach a high enough prestige and they just add up with nothing to save up for. If you do use points, keep pushing out content that allows you to purchase it with the points instead of currency like 1000 points for a personalization (sp?) pack instead of $1.99. It would keep people playing and you'll potentially sell more Micro DLC if it's cool enough.         **tl;dr**  Bottom Line is that there are alot of ways where you can make this potentially rival Modern Warfare 1 and 2 in the series. To be honest, I would be happy if about half of the above list was implemented. But if you want a game that you'll get minimal backlash for, these are the main issues I see with the games in general. The list can honestly go on and on. You have a built in fanbase - both competitive and casual - of millions of players who are ready and willing to praise Sledgehammer Games for their work on Advanced Warfare. I really do not hope this game ""screws the pooch"".",737,0.004070556309362279,0.0027137042062415195,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0027137042062415195,0.0013568521031207597,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0027137042062415195,0.0013568521031207597,0.004070556309362279,0.0013568521031207597,0.0027137042062415195,0.0027137042062415195,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0013568521031207597,0.0013568521031207597,0.005427408412483039,0.0067842605156037995,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0027137042062415195,0.0027137042062415195,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.004070556309362279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0027137042062415195,0.0,0.004070556309362279,0.008141112618724558,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.004070556309362279,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0027137042062415195,0.0013568521031207597,0.004070556309362279,0.0027137042062415195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0027137042062415195,0.0,0.008141112618724558,0.0,0.005427408412483039,0.004070556309362279,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0027137042062415195,0.0013568521031207597,0.0013568521031207597,0.004070556309362279,0.009497964721845319,0.009497964721845319,0.0027137042062415195,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0027137042062415195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008141112618724558,0.0027137042062415195,0.0013568521031207597,0.004070556309362279,0.004070556309362279,0.0,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.017639077340569877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009497964721845319,0.0027137042062415195,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0027137042062415195,0.004070556309362279,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0027137042062415195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.004070556309362279,0.004070556309362279,0.0,0.0,0.0027137042062415195,0.0027137042062415195,0.010854816824966078,0.0,0.0067842605156037995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0027137042062415195,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008141112618724558,0.0027137042062415195,0.005427408412483039,0.0,0.0,0.004070556309362279,0.0027137042062415195,0.0013568521031207597,0.0027137042062415195,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0027137042062415195,0.0013568521031207597,0.0013568521031207597,0.0,0.0013568521031207597,0.0013568521031207597,0.0027137042062415195,0.0013568521031207597,0.0

15,30u4i4,10146,2015-03-30 18:58:23,OpTicGaming,[Fluff] The only roster move for ON I can potentially see. My personal thoughts.,"Coming off of an early exit from CoD Champs and surprising many people, a popular opinion around here is that ON will make [yet] another roster change in the coming days/weeks. Now as I see it, Teep has had a couple of bad events, but I think he can shine after he gets Champs behind him. Karma just does what he does. He roams and slays with the best of them. Mir is a great consistent player imo. He can slay while playing the true OBJ and that's a rare trait. The only player I see ON dropping/trading at the moment is _PERSON_ because he can be inconsistent at events. While he did step up this past weekend, he has under performed in the other tournaments slaying wise.       If anything, I see _PERSON_ being dropped/traded for Enable or _PERSON_. ON needs someone who can perform consistently well while being the in game leader. _PERSON_ is an amazing communicator while being great in pretty much every game mode, and then you have one of the OGs of competitive console FPS in Enable. He is the experienced player everyone would love to have, plus throw in the fact that he is a great player and you have someone who can potentially turn ON around.                    If my opinion counts for anything here, I see these two as an upgrade to _PERSON_. Don't get me wrong, I love the guy. He's an extremely smart SnD God and will never have trouble finding a team because he is a great guy as well. But as of now, it would seem that ON doesn't really need him.",271,0.01845018450184502,0.007380073800738007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.007380073800738007,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01107011070110701,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.007380073800738007,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.014760147601476014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007380073800738007,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.007380073800738007,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.01107011070110701,0.0036900369003690036,0.007380073800738007,0.007380073800738007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.007380073800738007,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.02952029520295203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02214022140221402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02214022140221402,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.007380073800738007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01845018450184502,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0036900369003690036,0.0

Our lips met and...yeah.        **No, I didn't get her name. I ran out as fast as I could after that.**              Edit 1: I didn't expect any comments lol       **Update: Since this was a few weeks ago, I did run into her again before summer quarter started. Turns out she was pretty embarrassed about the whole thing as well and found it cute that I ran away for some reason.

27,v7736,10276,2012-06-18 00:12:07,aspergers,ASD and multitasking?,"Are People with ASD known to have serious multitasking problems? Because for me it's nearly impossible to do two things at a time or concentrate on multiple things at the same time. For example, unlike most people I can never concentrate on a lecture while taking notes or checking a text message on phone. I seem to lose track of what the instructor was saying very fast. Also, I can't listen to music and solve math questions at the same time. I can't even read an article on the web while listening to music. Similarly, when I'm watching sports on tv and I switch my attention to phone for checking twitter updates, I instantly lose focus of both. I can neither make much sense of tweets nor the match because I'm trying to focus on both. While most people on my twitter timeline or on IRC channels seem to be able to manage this very very well. Likewise, when I'm trying to concentrate on something it's like my other senses have stopped working. If i'm doing something (or even just thinking a random thought) and someone talks to me, I almost always have to ask them to repeat what they just said. How common is this problem?edit: another thing that just came to mind. Inability to focus on both audio and video in movies. Things seem to happen way too fast for me. Hence I always need subtitles while watching movies/tv shows. And if a movie doesn't have subtitles like in cinemas, i come out all confused not having understood most of the storyline for whatever reason.  This might also be because most movies/shows I watch are in english and english is not my native language but I seem to understand it very well. I've probably watched more american tv shows than even most americans. I have read a lot of english books and all. I can read, speak and understand english just fine.",324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0030864197530864196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0030864197530864196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006172839506172839,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.0030864197530864196,0.0030864197530864196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0030864197530864196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0030864197530864196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0030864197530864196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006172839506172839,0.0030864197530864196,0.006172839506172839,0.0,0.0030864197530864196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012345679012345678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0030864197530864196,0.006172839506172839,0.0,0.0030864197530864196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006172839506172839,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.0030864197530864196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012345679012345678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012345679012345678,0.009259259259259259,0.012345679012345678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0030864197530864196,0.0,0.0,0.0030864197530864196,0.0,0.006172839506172839,0.0,0.0030864197530864196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,0.0,0.0030864197530864196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006172839506172839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009259259259259259,0.0030864197530864196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015432098765432098,0.0030864197530864196,0.027777777777777776,0.006172839506172839,0.0,0.0030864197530864196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006172839506172839,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009259259259259259,0.0,0.0

30,wgenr,10276,2012-07-12 18:44:39,aspergers,ASD and excessive fatigue,"Is there a correlation between ASD and fatigue? I seem to get tired very easily and need to rest (take an hour long nap e.g) to just get through the day. I started noticing this in high school and the problem has only exacerbated since then. Back in HS, just two/three classes would wear me out physically as well as emotionally and I would spend the rest of the day with moderate to severe headache not concentrating in classes at all. Now that I'm in college, I don't have to take consecutive classes but still whenever I take two classes in a row, I come back to my room and take a long nap. This despite getting at least 7/8 hours of sleep every night. My roommate gets through the day easily and only sleeps at night.Even when I'm not taking classes i.e I have a few days off, I can't study for extended periods of time.

Due to my poor past experiences with psychiatrists and financial problems, I don't want to see one and am looking for a solution on my own.  I'm currently taking 2mg/day in the form of two 0.5mg pills in the morning and two in the evening. Is this amt. appropriate? also although i feel it is helping me and I feel better than before, I still feel quite anxious most of the time.

36,14ojql,10276,2012-12-11 20:09:35,aspergers,Persistent communication problems,"It's so frustrating not to be able to 'just converse' with people. And not just IRL. On phone too. I've been in an on-again, off-again relationship for a long time and the biggest problem i've faced is to not be able to talk like most people. I just sit quietly in front of her with my head absolutely blank. On phone, i ask her a few cliché questions which she's not interested in talking about, eventually ending up scratching my head trying to figure out what to say. A lot of times, the frustration results in me making a joke she finds offensive or me saying something i regret later. Simple miscommunication has resulted in a lot of discontent.  I haven't had a conversation that lasted more than 5 mins and didnt revolve around studies with my mom/dad/uncles/cousins in years. Just being in their presence makes me feel so very uncomfortable. This is the biggest reason i simply avoid seeing people. Communication problems coupled with anxieties of all sorts make the whole process very difficult. And seeing people able to converse so well effortlessly makes this feeling all the more worse. I see people saying stuff to each other and think 'why does any of this never occur to me'? I've tried noting down interesting stuff that i can say to people, stuff i see IRL or on TV but it hasn't made much of a difference. The only proper conversations i have with people revolve around my special interests or studies. There are many ASD related issues that have significantly affected my life but this is one of the things that depress me the most.  Please share any tips that have helped you people and can help me deal with this and salvage whatever is left of my relationship.",300,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006666666666666667,0.0033333333333333335,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006666666666666667,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.01,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.0033333333333333335,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.006666666666666667,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.006666666666666667,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.03,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033333333333333335

There was a time, not so long ago, when i could read for hours just fine. But now just two or so hours into it my mind reaches a sort of saturation point where i just feel mentally exhausted and my mind doesnt absorb anything i'm reading. I usually need a nap for this to go away. But even after taking a nap it comes back real soon. I've been wondering if this has anything to do with anxiety/depression etc. or is a side effect of medication i'm taking.

47,1tlvpa,10276,2013-12-24 14:34:14,Android,Is Moto G a good buy for a long time windows phone user?,"I've used windows phone as my daily driver almost ever since it came out and I've been mostly satisfied with it. I'm now looking to give android a shot to see if things have improved since the gingerbread days and also because Moto G promises excellent value for money. However, I'm put off by my past experiences with android. I'm someone who can't stand lag at all and wants buttery smooth, consistently reliable experience. Despite all the limitations of windows phone, I loved it because there was not one time when I wanted to do something on it and it let me down. Does Moto G offer as reliable an experience on the software front? and also if i do decide to go with it, do in need to worry about performance deteriorating over time (as was the case with android a couple years ago)?

Screen, design, camera etc. are good. I hate the placement and shape of lock button. Really hard to press. And I cant get it to connect to my campus wifi network. Thats a huge bummer. Since, 8X doesn't have a card slot, I have to now rely on data connection to download apps or do anything online. Anyway, I was hoping you guys could suggest WP8 only apps and games and also share some new things you have discovered since the WP7.5 era.

That way we won't have to open the app every time to get a detailed status. One scenario where this could be useful is sports apps like sofascore. I currently have toasts enabled for it so that it sends me goal alerts and so on. However, since Action Center doesn't display full notifications, I have to open the app every time to find out who scored the goal and so on. A weird limitation.  Also, why is it not possible to clear individual notifications from Action center? What if I just want to clear one and keep the rest for an app as a sort of reminder for later? A better implementation imo would've been 'swipe the app title to the right to remove all notifications, swipe a notification to the right to remove just that one'. When I first used the Action Center, I was expecting it to be like this. It was disappointing to find out that is not the case.",180,0.011111111111111112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011111111111111112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011111111111111112,0.0,0.005555555555555556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005555555555555556,0.0,0.005555555555555556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005555555555555556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005555555555555556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005555555555555556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005555555555555556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011111111111111112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005555555555555556,0.0,0.005555555555555556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011111111111111112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Honestly, it was one of the most gratifying feelings ever, watching the Joker get knocked out and fall from the top of the tower. I watched my brother beat it when I was younger, and never could do it. I picked it up again recently and was determined to finally finish it, regardless of how long it took. I have practiced and practiced and practiced, learning strategy and boss patterns, and it resulted in a 3 hour stint blasting through the game, culminating in the final showdown. It's amazing how games that are over 20 years old and so simple in their mechanics can give you more satisfaction upon completion than most games of the modern age. Anyways, just wanted to share my success (and my happiness) with you all.

62,e5db6,-44823,2010-11-12 23:24:23,Minecraft,I wrote an app to help record Minecraft for Youtube.,"I recorded a video of my cactus farm last night for Reddit and only after it was fully uploaded did I realize it wouldn't generate a 720p video. I use fraps at 1900x1200 but half the resolution for recording as 1080p would be huge and take a ton of I/O. The only solution is to run the window at 720p or change my resolution. I wrote an app to help with the former. It's written in VB 6.0 (.. I know.. I know) and it's pretty dirty. It gives a full list of windows, lets you pick one and adjust exactly the dimensions of it then re-size it. I couldn't find anything like this out there already so I was wondering if there would be interest? If I post it I'll include the source code and clean it up a bit.Any budding Minecraft video makers see this as useful?**Edit:** So I've switched over to using Perl. It's much more transportable as I can compile it without requiring runtime files.

67,f8x15,-44823,2011-01-25 20:38:17,techsupport,One of the strangest computer repairs I've done.,"So here's the setup. Last Saturday my computer wouldn't boot up. Self-built Core 2 Duo E8500 stock clock and a Gigabyte Motherboard in a CM HAF 932. Power button didn't do anything. Tried all the standard non-invasive things to troubleshoot and nothing.I unplugged everything and took it to the kitchen table . Tried shorting the power switch pins manually in case it was a bad power button and that didn't work either. Went and bought a new power supply and replaced the power connectors to the motherboard with the new supply. Still nothing. Guess it's something more serious. Time for an upgrade! :DWent and got a new ASUS P8P67, i5 2500k, and 8 gigs of DDR3. Put it all together in my case, hit the power and it started up. Ahh, bad motherboard and/or cpu I guess? Anyhow I plugged everything in, closed it up and installed it under my desk. It was, however, not an happily ever after story.On the first bootup I got a message about USB overload and was told that the system would shut down in 15 seconds. I started unplugging usb devices one at a time to pinpoint which one was acting up. Finally it was just the keyboard and still with the message. Unplugged it and... still USB overload....Then I had a flashback to Saturday. I accidentally stepped on my iphone data cable and heard something snap. I saw a bit of black plastic on the carpet but figured I had snapped it off the bottom of the case. Nope, that was from one of the front USB connectors. I took a loser look and part of it had collapsed which was obviously shorting out the usb port. Once I unplugged the cable connecting that header to the MB, everything was fine.I've been working on computer for 25+ years and this is definitely in the top 3 of strange and hard to diagnose issues. Now I've got my old motherboard here sitting at work so I can test it out. Hopefully it's fine so I can sell it. (E8500 -&gt; i5 2500k is quite a nice jump, not returning anything).

It's a guy who just broke up or was broken up with a girl. It starts with him in the bathroom getting ready to go out with his friends. Then he's in a bar. Later he's walking along a bridge at night and I am pretty sure he jumps/falls in but comes back up and/or is saved.

82,25z0au,-44823,2014-05-19 20:53:07,mythtv,I made a script for MythTV + HDHomerun to remove unsubscribed channels.,"It's a simple perl script. A quick and dirty hackjob but it's really made my mythtv experience a lot more enjoyable so I thought I'd share. The HDHomerun tuner has the ability to detect which channels are available and what you're subscribed to. This script will use this functionality to turn off the visibility of channels you don't have access to.Steps to use:  0) Back up your database or be prepared to re-enable all channels.  1) Visit your HDHomerun device on your network via this url:  _URL_  2) Click ""Detect Channels""  3) Once it's finished, download and modify this script:_URL_  Be sure to update your database information as well as the ip address for your hdhomerun device in the $url variable.  4) Have you backed up your database? It couldn't hurt!  5) Run this script.
